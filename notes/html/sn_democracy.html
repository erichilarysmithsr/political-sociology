<h1>Summary notes on democracy</h1>

<h3>Lipset, Seymour. 1959. "Some social requisites of democracy: economic development and political legitimacy." <em>APSR</em> 53.</h3>

<p>Lipset here is making a few arguments. This article is usually referenced to refer to the talk about how economic development is related to the development of democracy. He certainly does suggest that, but he also suggests a few mechanisms through which this occurs. The first is education, a high correlate of economic modernization. Education helps to sustain and create belief in democratic norms. It also helps to ensure a belief in gradual change and not extremist ones. He suggests that national income affects receptivity to democratic political norms, and that it is related to the presence of civil society organizations, which media participation and are a source of alternative opinions.</p>

<p>In the second part of the piece, he discusses legitimacy and democracy. Stability of a democracy depends on how effective and legitimate it is. The degree of legitimacy of a regime helps weather crises of effectiveness. One source of legitimacy is maintaining continuity of primarily conservative and integrative institutions during a transitional period. A major test of legitimacy is the extent to which nations have developed a 'secular political culture'. Legitimacy also helps in maintaining stability where there is strong cleavages and tensions among political contenders. </p>

<h3>James Mahoney. 2003. "Knowledge accumulation in comparative-historical research: the case of democracy and authoritarianism" in <em>Comparative Historical Analysis</em></h3>

<p>Mahoney is mostly useful here in outlining three research programs in the study of democracy and authoritarianism. Barrington Moore's research program is class-based and structural, and brings in a strong historical component, that sequence matters. The O'Donnell research program is also structural but is based more on dependency theory. The Linz-Stepan research program is focused more on agency and voluntarism.</p>

<h3>Joseph Schumpeter. 1947. <em>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em>.</h3>

<p>Definitions of democracy - the 18th century philosophy of democracy:  "the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions which realizes the common good by making the people itself decide issues through the election of individuals who are to assemble in order to carryout its will."</p>

<p>The modern definition which many theorists adopt: "The democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote." </p>

<h3>Robert Dahl. 1971. <em>Polyarchy</em>.</h3>

<p>Dahl wants to ask what the conditions are for the emergence of a democracy, or in his terms, a polyarchy. He first outlines the particular institutional guarantees that a regime must provide for it to be a polyarchy. Individuals must have the change to formulate preferences, signify preferences to their fellow citizens and the government by individual and collective action, and have their preferences weighed equally in the conduct of government. He divides regimes along two dimensions: public contestation and inclusiveness. A polyarchy is one in which both inclusiveness and contestation are high.</p>

<h3>Barrington Moore Jr. 1966. <em>Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy</em></h3>

<p>(notes from CH prelim)</p>

<p>Moore is plotting out the different trajectories to "modernity" for his case studies. He outlines three paths to it: bourgeois democracy (USA, Britain, France), fascism (German, Japan), and communism (China, Russian). He also details a bit of information on India, but does not treat it with as much rigor as those previous cases. In his account, Moore pays special attention to the political roles played by landed upper classes and the peasantry. The countries under investigation are primarily agrarian when they start the process and are in transition to modern industrial states. In the movement from the agrarian state to democracy, contenders need to check arbitrary rules, replace arbitrary rules with just and rational ones, and obtain a share for the underlying population in the making of the rules. Bourgeoisie are central to competing with landed elites in creating modern democracy. In short, "no bourgeois, no democracy." In the movement to fascism, there is less of a bourgeois impulse. Weak commercial and industrial class relied on elements of older and dominant landed ruling classes. And in the progress towards communism, agrarian bureaucracies inhibited commercial and industrial impulses; urban classes were weak and landed classes had to content with many peasant revolts.</p>

<p>On comparison and method, Moore includes India as a negative check on the other case studies. He doesn't particularly buy into the idea of Mill's method of difference, since "Identity never occurs in history." He is also suspicious of the independence of cases in comparison, since events occur in world-time and one will certain influence the other. Moore's account is textured and attentive to historical particularities and contingencies.</p>

<h3>Dietrich Rueschemeyer et al. 1992. <em>Capitalist Development and Democracy</em></h3>

<p>Rueschemeyer, Stephens, and Stephens are trying to develop a theory of the relationship of capitalism to the development of democracy that gets away from the modernization thesis, which effectively says that the more development a country has, the more likely it will have a democracy. Studies that say this are mostly quantitative. They take a more comparative-historical approach, and they attempt to do so over a substantially greater number of countries in different world regions. They take a political economy perspective and emphasize the role of the working class in the development of democracy. Democracy, here, is defined as a matter of power and increase in political equality. Social class they find to be the most important factor because capitalist development transforms class structure and changes the balance of power between classes. This should be distinguished between liberal and some orthodox Marxist theories that see the middle class as the driver of democracy. The middle class here can go either way, depending on the necessary class alliances.</p>

<p>Methodologically and conceptually, they take a historical and mechanism perspective here, emphasizing sequences and also the difference mechanisms that emergence in each specific case. So there are different mechanisms in operation in each region that have to do with the arrangement of social classes that explains the variation in democratization.</p>

<h3>Guillermo A. O'Donnell. 1973. <em>Modernization and Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism</em></h3>

<p>O'Donnell wants to debunk the modernization thesis for political democracy for South America. He says that it is wrong to lump the core with the periphery and look at both. Instead, need to disentangle and look closer. He suggests that Argentina and Brazil saw high levels of modernization and technological development, but then experienced a period of decline and political retrenchment. This resulted in what he calls a bureaucratic-authoritarian regime, which is characterized by high modernization, no political democracy, and an excluding system of government. He suggests the nature of modernization is curvilinear -- medium modernization with no excluding system has political democracy, but those with low modernization have a populist-authoritarianism. </p>

<h3>Juan Linz. 1978. <em>The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes: Crisis, Breakdown, and Reequilibration</em>.</h3>

<p>Linz wants to develop an actor-centric account of why democratic regimes breakdown, and understand the dynamic processes through which they do so. He argues that views of legitimacy, efficacy, and effectiveness are key, and that the presence and strength of the disloyal opposition are as well.  The process of breakdown is the result of a leader-precipitated crisis and their inability to solve the issue. The disloyal opposition presents itself as a solution, undermining legitimacy, efficacy, and efficiency. This leads to transfer of power, polarization, and civil war. Outcome is eventually regime reconsolidation or reequilibrium towards some form of democracy after a possible reign of nondemocratic rule.</p>

<h3>Magen, Amichai. 2009. "Evaluating external influence on democratic development: transition." Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law working paper.</h3>

<p>Magen reviews the different approaches to democratic transition. First is the move away from treating political democracy as a dichotomous variable.  A regime can have more or less democratic institutions. In the third wave, seeing the rise of many hybrid types, making the concept seem more like a continuum. Two approaches rule the transitions literature - that of the structural approach which ascribes cause to a number of different structures. The second is the agency-based, actor-focused approach which focuses on precipitants and causes of transition, rather than long-term societal change. All of these need to focus more on external causes and specify the mechanisms through which external factors are linked with domestic causes. Maybe a possible return to world systems theory.</p>

<h3>Huntington, Samuel. 1991. "Democracy's Third Wave." <em>Journal of Democracy</em> 2(2).</h3>

<p>Huntington argues that there are five factors that have contributed to the occurrence and timing of the third wave of democratization: deepening legitimacy problems of authoritarian regimes caused by word acceptance of democratic norms; global economic growth; shift in the doctrine and activities of the Catholic Church; changes in policies of major external actors; and "snowballing" or regional Domino effects. He suggests impediments exist with countries that have no prior experience to democracy, authoritarian rulers, no commitment to democracy values, and cultures hostile to democracy.</p>

<h3>Kalyvas, Stathis. 2000. "Commitment Problems in Emerging Democracies: The Case of Religious Parties." <em>Comparative Politics</em> 32(4): 379-398.</h3>

<p>Kalyvas wants to know how, in emerging democracies, radical religious challengers who possibly have an interest in destroying democracy from within can be tempered and signal that they are willing to act democratically once in power. He compares contemporary Algeria and 19th century Belgium and finds that divisions and institutions within both incumbents and challengers are important. In Algeria, the ruling bloc was very adverse to the Islamic challengers, partially because they had been multivocal, both moderate and radical, a result of decentralized structures of Islam. In contrast, incumbents were trusting of the Catholic party, which spoke with one force and had been able to temper its radicals through its hierarchical and autocratic structure.</p>
