<li>Puzzle: changes in Israel's treatment of Palestinian detainees -- why?</li>
<li>Theory: world polity and neo-institutionalism. Israel needs to present itself in a such a way that it comports with how the world views them. They must maintain legitimacy.</li>
<li>Major claim: Palestinian public relations skill provided international organizations, namely International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and B'Tselem (Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories) with a push that moved their cause onto the world agenda. Palestinian groups triggered world polity scrutiny.</li>
