<h1>Fraser, Nancy. 1990. "Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy." <em>Social Text</em> 25/26.</h1>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Habermas as important to clarify some important debates in Left social movements.</li>
<li>However, a larger problem is that contemporary feminisms use the term "the public sphere" to mean anything that is outside of the domestic or familial sphere. So this conflates three analytically distinct things: the state, the official-economy of paid employment, and arenas of public discourse.
<ul>
<li>Habermas's concept can help to disambiguate this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But the way that Habermas has elaborated the concept needs to undergo some critical reconstruction if can be capable of theorizing the limits of actually existing democracy.</li>
<li>Habermas stops short of developing a public sphere for a post-bourgeois model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The public sphere: alternative histories, competing conceptions
<ul>
<li>Public sphere in Habermas as an institutional mechanism for rationalizing political domination by rendering states accountable to some citizenry. At another level, a discursive interaction -- discussion of all public matters.
<ul>
<li>This never was realized in practices due to special interests and emergence of welfare state mass democracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recent revisionist historiography suggests that Habermas's account idealizes the liberal public sphere.
<ul>
<li>Public sphere was predicated on a number of significant exclusions - formal exclusion of women by the construction of a more "rational", masculinist public sphere.</li>
<li>Sphere had been limited to bourgeois men, who came to see themselves as a "universal class." New gender norms arising that enjoin feminine domesticity and a sharp separation of public and private spheres functions as signifiers of bourgeois difference from both higher and lower social strata. This eventually became hegemonic, imposed and embraced by other segments of society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Habermas not only idealizes the liberal public sphere but fails to examine other, nonliberal, nonbourgeois, competing public spheres. Women were finding other pathways into public political life.</li>
<li>The idea that women were excluded from public sphere turns out to be ideology, based on class- and gender-biased notion of publicity, accepts at face value that the bourgeois claim to be the public.</li>
<li>In fact, were a number of competing counterpublics. Relation between these publics were always conflictual.
<ul>
<li>Bourgeois public sphere was not simply an unrealized ideal, but was also masculinist ideological notion that functioned to legitimate an emergent form of class rule, one that moved from direct domination to hegemony.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So what is to be done with the concept of public sphere? Calls into question four assumptions:
<ol>
<li>assumption that is possible for interlocutors in a public sphere to bracket status differentials and to deliberate "as if" they were social equals; the assumption, therefore, that societal equality is not a necessary condition for political democracy;</li>
<li>assumption that the proliferation of a multiplicity of competing publics is necessarily a step away from, rather than toward, greater democracy, and that a single, comprehensive public sphere is always preferable to a nexus of multiple publics;</li>
<li>the assumption that discourse in public spheres should be restricted to deliberation about the common good, and that the appearance of "private interests" and "private issues" is always undesirable;</li>
<li>assumption that a functioning democratic public sphere requires a sharp separation between civil society and the state.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open access, participatory parity, and social equality
<ul>
<li>In practice, status differentials not actually bracketed. Public sphere governed by protocols of style and decorum that were correlates and markers of status inequality.
<ul>
<li>Similar ways in which deliberation can serve for a mask for domination. </li>
<li>Bracketing works to the advantage of dominant groups and disadvantage of subordinates.</li>
<li>Would be more approach to unbracket inequalities in the sense of explicitly thematizing them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Culture also cannot be neutral - unequally empowered social groups tend to develop unequally valued cultural styles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Equality, diversity, and multiple publics
<ul>
<li>Considering "interpublic relations" - character of interactions among different publics.</li>
<li>Habermas's account suggests that a single, unified  public sphere is positive and desirable.</li>
<li>In stratified societies, arrangements that accommodate contestation among a plurality of competing publics better promotes the ideal of participatory parity than does a single, comprehensive overarching public, for the reasons stated above about the marginalization of dominated groups in a single public.
<ul>
<li><em>Subaltern counterpublics</em> - as alternative publics in which subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, allowing them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs.</li>
<li>These publics function as spaces of withdrawal and regroupment, and as bases for agitational activities directed toward wider publics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In classless, egalitarian, multi-cultural societies, is one or multiple publics preferable?
<ul>
<li>Publics are arenas for formation and enactment of social identities.</li>
<li>So multiple publics would be preferable, given the multiple rhetorical and stylistic norms.</li>
<li>This does not rule out the possibly of a broader public in which individuals all interact as well. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Public spheres, common concerns, and private interests
<ul>
<li>What counts as public matter and what is private?</li>
<li>What is of concern to everyone? People will disagree.
<ul>
<li>Cannot assume that a common good will be amendable to everyone in advance. Individuals must come to debate and find where their disagreements lie.</li>
<li>In general, critical theory needs to be more critical of the terms "public" and "private" -- in political discourse, they serve to delegitimate some interests, views, and topics and to valorize others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rhetoric of economic privacy seeks to exclude some issues and interests from debate by economizing them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strong publics, weak publics: on civil society and the state
<ul>
<li>Thinking of "civil society" as nongovernmental or "secondary" associations that are neither economic nor administrative. </li>
<li>Bourgeois public sphere supposes the desirability of a sharp separation of civil society and the state. 
<ul>
<li>It promotes "weak publics" - publics whose deliberative practice consists exclusively in opinion-formation and does not also encompass decision-making. </li>
<li>Also suggests that public sphere should not include decision-making, lest it be incorporated into the state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strong publics incorporate decision-making, thus blurring line between civil society and the state.</li>
<li>This gets at questions of accountability, of participatory and representative democracy.</li>
<li>Point is that the idea of a public sphere that makes a sharp separation of civil society and the state excludes forms of self-management, inter-public coordination, and political accountability that are critical for democratic and egalitarian society.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
