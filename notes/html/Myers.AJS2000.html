<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>LA Watts riot as triggering the wave of urban racial riots in
1960s. </li>
<li>Raised the prospect of a new protest tactic that supplanted CRM. </li>
<li>Predicting riots using social and economic conditions as very
difficult. </li>
<li>Some idea that riots were "contagious" to one another. </li>
<li>This article reexams riot wave for evidence of diffusion effects
by using event history approach to diffusion modeling. </li>
<li>Riot diffusion is controlled by severity of the riot, suggesting
importance of media attention.</li>
<li>Cities different in their responsiveness to contagious influence
from other cities and these differences are tied to size of black
population in each city.</li>
<li>Television broadcast patterns are of critical importance in
tramitting the propensit to riot from one location to another.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Riot contagion
<ul>
<li>Necessary to bring back the idea of contagion, decouple it from
the theory of the LeBonian crowd.</li>
<li>How and why would contagion arise with riots in general and
racial riots of the 1960s in particular?</li>
<li><em>Long-term contributions to riot waves</em> - Some kind of positive
reinforcement results from rioting, whether real or
imagined. Riots were providing a model for a new kind of protest
behavior. </li>
<li><em>Short-term contagion effects</em> - Notion of reinforcement
effects. Well-publicized collective action provides other
potential actors with an "occasion for deciding" - not only in
informal networks but also in news coverage and editorials.</li>
<li><em>Recent diffusion modeling</em> - New advances in diffusion modeling
allows for testing a new range of diffusion/contagion
hypotheses.
<ul>
<li>In event history diffusion models, diffusion is modeled as a
dynamic process in which prior adoptions are constantly
changing their effects on the rate of adoption. Prior adoption
is accumulated as it occurs, and its influence changes to
reflect accumption. [not quite sure what this means]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In this work, asking (1) whether there are characteristics of a city
or of the riot which make the riot more or less contagious; (2)
what factors make one city more susceptible to influence than
others; (3) necessary to map the mass media network to determine
where prior riots will be most contagios and therefore where
future rioting is most likely to break out.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heterogeneous diffusion models
<ul>
<li>Timing of adoption events as central. Spatial and temporal
homogeneity as assumptions. But not necessarily so, given the
distribution of communication network concentration.</li>
<li>This brings in the argument for event history diffusion models. </li>
<li>Four types of diffusion related predictors: intrinsic
characteristics, infectiousness, susceptibility, and proximity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypotheses about riot diffusion
<ol>
<li>Media attention bias contributed to the diffusion of riots. 
<ul>
<li>media network is not a transparent conduit of information. Has
bias.</li>
<li>News media are more like to report events that involve larger
numbers of people.</li>
<li>Events near to the media source are more likely to be reported
than those which are farther away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cities were more less receptive to contagious influence as a
function of their black populations. Those with larger black
populations are more resistant to contagious influence than those
with small ones.</li>
<li>Network of influence among cities was defined not only by
geographic position of cities, but also by proximity within mass
media distribution networks.
<ul>
<li>Distribution of mass media provides a link among collective
actors, and these links can be used to define a network amongst
cities. </li>
<li>Two possible network structures: 1) responsive network
structure (equivalence among connected cities); 2) asymmetric
nework structure, which presumes that information about riots
occurring in media-rich cities is distributed to all connected
cities but that information about riots in media-poor cities is
not because they do not have the capacity to broadcast their
news to other cities. </li>
<li>Responsive network posits that all cities within the broadcast
range of a single television station affect one another.</li>
<li>Asymmetric network is same except that it assumes a much strong
media attention bias. Small cities without television stations
are able to be infected but cannot infect other ones.</li>
<li>Indegree as the important variable for diffusion adoption.</li>
