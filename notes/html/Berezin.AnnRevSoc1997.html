<ol>
<li>Mapping the field
<ul>
<li>Four subareas that have emerged as significant for the study of politics and culture: political culture, institutions, political communication and meaning, and collective action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Political culture versus politics and culture
<ul>
<li>There is a distinction between "politics and culture" and "political culture."
<ul>
<li>The former suggests that each term constitutes an autonomous realm. </li>
<li>The latter is the matrix of meanings embodied in expressive symbols, practices, and beliefs that constitute ordinary politics in a bounded collectivity. Assumption is that attitudes determine political practices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Focus of political culture has turned to look at civil society and democratization.</li>
<li><em>Theories of civil society</em> - civil society as the social space in which democractic polity is enacted.
<ul>
<li>According to Habermas, what separates democratic practices from what has come before is existence of a separate sphere that is neither state nor church, where individuals form publics and debate political ideas and practices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Democracy and culture</em> - Putnam, Tocqueville, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>States and institutions
<ul>
<li>Interest in culture in defining state formation.</li>
<li>Looking into the cultural side of institutionalism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Political communication and meaning
<ul>
<li>Cultural practices provide empirical focus for analysis of the dissemination of knowledge about politics.</li>
<li>How do particular audiences receive political information?</li>
<li>Studying ritual and symbolic processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collective action
<ul>
<li>Cultural turn in study of contentious politics. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
