<h1>Somers, Margaret. 1993. "Citizenship and the Place of the Public Sphere: Law, Community, and Political Culture in the Transition to Democracy." <em>ASR</em> 58(5).</h1>

<p><em>Basic thrust</em> - theories of citizenship based on T.H. Marshall's definition have three assumptions: citizenship must be defined as a status; capitalist development and citizenship formation must occur together; and theories of citizenship must be based on the relationship between the state and capitalism. Instead, we should think of citizenship as "instituted process"; the development of citizenship rights depended on the nexus of England's national legal infrastructure and the varying community capacities for participatory association; and we must look at the relationship between public spheres, associational life, and patterns of political culture to further understand citizenship.</p>
