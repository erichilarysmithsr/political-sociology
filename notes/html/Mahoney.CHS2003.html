<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>What is knowledge accumulation in social sciences?</li>
<li>Most social scientists seem to agree, at least implicitly.</li>
<li>Focusing on knowledge accumulation with regards to CH, focusing
on origins on democratic and authoritarian national regimes. </li>
<li>Focusing on three research programs - Barrington Moore, Guillermo
O'Donnell, and Linz and Stephan.</li>
<li>Documenting the knowledge accumulation that has occurred in each
of these research programs. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defining knowledge accumulation
<ul>
<li>Accumulation occurs when generation of new knowledge is dependent
on previously obtained knowledge. </li>
<li>Four elements of knowledge - descriptive findings, causal
findings, methodologies, and meta-theories. 
<ul>
<li>Descriptive does not necessarily entail accumulation because it
does not build on other knowledge.</li>
<li>Causal findings can build by either hypothesis testing or
hypothesis elaboration. </li>
<li>Progressive research traditions as accumulation with respect to
tools - methodology and meta-theory.</li>
<li>Methodology as procedures that generate description and causal
inferences. </li>
<li>Meta-theory as overarching assumptions and orientations that
can be used to form empirical puzzles and hypotheses. </li>
<li>Methodologies can also accumulate - e.g. Mill's methods to
Boolean algebra, to fuzzy set analysis. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Barrington Moore's research program
<ul>
<li>Serves more to inspired hypothesis elaboration and
meta-theoretical development, rather than specifically outlined
hypotheses. </li>
<li>Moore as bringing back to the fore two elements of meta-theory:
structuralism and the importance of temporal ordering. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>O'Donnell and Linz-Stephan research programs
<ul>
<li>O'Donnell as having distinctive concepts and hypotheses separate
from the Moore program. Based on dependency theory. </li>
<li>Linz-Stepan research program focused on agency and voluntarism,
moved away from structuralist approaches of Moore and
O'Donnell. This had less success in stimulating a focused program
as the others did, however, it stimulated accumulation in
descriptive findings. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul>
<li>The research community that accumulates knowned is more valid and
more enlightening than the noncumulative one.</li>
<li>To test the extent to which a research program is cumulative --
how much one would lose if you were to strike it from the
record. </li>
</ul></li>
