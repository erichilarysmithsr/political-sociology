<h1>Jennifer Earl and Katrina Kimport. 2012. <em>Digitally Enabled Social Change</em></h1>

<h2>Ch. 1 - Intoduction</h2>

<ol>
<li>E-mobilizations
<ul>
<li>using the web to mobilize people towards offline events.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>E-movements
<ul>
<li>movements that are entirely hosted online</li>
</ul></li>
<li>E-tactics
<ul>
<li>e.g. petitions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Leveraging affordances
<ul>
<li>Two affordances of the web: creating, organizing, and
participating in protest; and ability to aggregate people's
individual actions into broader collective actions w/o requiring
copresence in time and space. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordances and the dynamics of protest
<ul>
<li>Continuum of how much affordances are leveraged, moving from
e-mobilization, to e-tactics, to e-movements. </li>
<li>The more that these leverages are afforded, the more that ICTs
are transformative and we need to build new theory to account for
this. </li>
<li>Ways that people leverage technology through mundane or
innovative uses, is what changes social processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Understanding leveraged online contention through e-tactics
<ul>
<li>There has been much more research on less leveraged uses of the
Web than the more leveraged ones. </li>
<li>This book is an attempt on understanding the more leveraged uses
of the web. Focusing on e-tactics and how this changes
processes of organizing and participation. </li>
<li>Although some deride "five-minute activism" we need to understand
its social consequences. Argument is made in Ch. 5 that forms of
action that strongly leverage cost affordances reduce the
importance of SMOs. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>A digital repertoire of contention?
<ul>
<li>Tilly's shift from traditional to modern repertoire</li>
<li>But what are their similarities?</li>
<li>Possible new repetoire in the digital. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>A bird's eye view: out population-level study of e-tactics
<ul>
<li>Content coding of quasirandom sample of sites gathered in 2004</li>
<li>Two categories of sites: warehouse and non-warehouse
sites. Former as hosting content submitted by users,
clearinghouses for protest. Nonwarehouse as diverse, varied. </li>
<li>Looking at the kinds of claims the sites made, as well as form
sof protest actions. Relationships to social movements and SMOs,
and targets of action. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Ch. 2 - Where we have been and where we are headed</h2>

<ol>
<li>Introduction 
<ul>
<li>pointing out methodological and theoretical splits
among researchers studying Web protest</li>
<li>introducing leveraged affordances approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prior research on web activism
<ul>
<li>Are we able to explain the various onlien actions as we are able
to explain street protests? If not, what needs to change in our
theories?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are social processes accelerated or altered? - Two schools of
 thought: 1) scale-related changes but no definitive effect on
 processes underlying activism; and 2) model-level changes 
<ul>
<li>Model level changes - making anyone an activist, Shirky's view
of organizing, for example. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes you find (only) what you look for
<ul>
<li>Divergent findings are perhaps produced by the cases that each
camp tends to study. 
<ul>
<li>E-mobilizations in the prior case, and e-movements in the
other. Very little attention to e-tactics. </li>
<li>Need to focus more on this. E-tactics as part of the daily live
of politically engaged individuals. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's all (or al least mostly) in how you use it
<ul>
<li>It's not technologies that lead to social and political
changes. It's people's uses of technologies, that lead to
changes. </li>
<li>Technological affordances - "what actions or uses a technology
makes easier (and therefore facilitates)"; "the action and uses
that a technology makes qualitative easier or possible when
compared to prior like technologies"</li>
<li>Hard to notice affordances, since some of them seem so mundane,
and not everyone leverages technologies in the same way. </li>
<li>Term "affordance" is used in HCI studies. </li>
<li>Affordances as trying to get beyond the "technological
determinist" (technology determines social outcomes) and the
"constructivist" (how technology matters to social life is
socially constituted or constructed) views of technology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implications for social movement theory
<ul>
<li>Do not have to reject social movement theory, but see where it
needs to edited to think of costs of participation and
organizing as variable [does it not already do this?]</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Ch. 3 - The Look and Fell of E-Tactics and Their Websites</h2>

<ol>
<li>Types of e-tactics
<ol>
<li>Petitions
<ul>
<li>has been a popular protest tactic in the past</li>
<li>most common form of e-tactic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Boycotts
<ul>
<li>Classic protest tactic</li>
<li>Through the web, targeting corporations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Letter-writing and email campaigns
<ul>
<li>Shifting from paper letter campaigns to e-campaigns</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Studying e-tactics
<ul>
<li>Getting away from focusing on one site or a set of sites that are
deeply connected to each other.</li>
<li>Starting from the question - how are people using e-tactics,
especially those highlighted above. </li>
<li>Population sampling approach 
<ul>
<li>population as reachable websites hosting or linking to oneof
the four kinds of e-tactics. </li>
<li>Googling various queries - top thousand results.</li>
<li>randomly sampling from each list. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Warehouse versus nonwarehouse sites
<ul>
<li>warehosue sites as hosting one kind of tactic.</li>
<li>nonwarehouse sites as a variety - individual blog campaigns,
websites of traditional SMO</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
