<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Do processes of Internet activism differ from offline activism?
Put differently - does it accentuate activism or change it more
fundamental way. </li>
<li>Since there are divergent answers here, introducing
four-category typology to distinguish between broad types of
activism. </li>
<li>Do trends in what is being studied reflect underlying empirical
patterns? Or is there selection bias. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact of Internet usage on social movement processes. Three ways
 scholars view this
<ol>
<li>No real difference between the offline and the online. You need
strong ties. </li>
<li>Internet may change activism in fundamental ways. It has
diminished the importance of resources. Robust offline
relationships may be weakened for some types of Internet
activism.</li>
<li>Most people are some place in between, however. "Scale effects" </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Understanding findings on the impacts of Internet usage
<ul>
<li>Researchers are studying qualitatively different kinds of
Internet activism. </li>
<li>Outlined a four-category typology:
<ol>
<li>Brochure-ware - Information distribution</li>
<li>Online facilitation of offline activism - providing information
on, logistical support for, and/or recruitment for offline
protest events</li>
<li>Online participation - Providing actual venues for
participation while online</li>
<li>Online organizing - Entire campaigns as organized online</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Case selection bias
<ul>
<li>Does research supporting scale changes predominate because the
types of activism associated with scale-related changes
empirically predominate?</li>
<li>Data does not bear this out. Sites are 44% brochure-ware,
followed by online action only. Online facilitation of offline
activism is overstudied. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
