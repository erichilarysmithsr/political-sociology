<h1>Michels, Robert. 1911. Notes on iron law.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Robert Michels's (1911/1962) well-known "iron law of oligarchy" provides one explanation for the drift from flat, participatory structures toward a centralized system of control and a gradual shift away from original goals. Michels was Weber's pupil and shared his views on bureaucracy. Michels held that because organizational growth leads to complexity and problems of internal coordination, management adopts bureaucratic mechanisms to bring order and predictability. As organizations grow, they not only gain internal complexity, they also develop more extensive and complex relationships with other institutions. When external legitimacy is enhanced, leaders become more oriented toward their institutional environment and less oriented toward their organization's initial goals (from Lowrey 2012)</li>
