<h1>Snow and Benford, 1988 -- "Ideology, Frame Resonance, and Participant Mobilization"</h1>

<h2>Notes from Ermakoff's seminar, Fall 2010</h2>

<ol>
<li>The breaking down of frames into subcategories: a) diagnosis; b) prognostic; and c) motivational.  Motivations need to be framed.  You cannot assume that merely by diagnosing you will motivate people -- "consensus mobilization does not necesarily yield to mobilization" (p. 202); "diagnostic frames alone... do little to affect action mobilization" (p. 203)</li>
<li>Broad descriptive framework that identifies conditional factors.  Four parameters are identified:
<ol>
<li>the consistency of the frames themselves. How do they relate to one and other?  Do they form a good integrated structure?  "The more the three tasks are robust..." (p. 199)</li>
<li>Belief centrality -- resonance with the broader belief system of potential consistuents. To what extent do these frames come into accord with personal beliefs.</li>
<li>experiential credibility -- how much does frame accord with personal experiences.
Phenomenological relevance to one's own experience</li>
<li>cycles of mobilization -- the impact of a frame depends on when it is used during the cycle process.  There is a certain path dependency that earlier protests have on latter protests.</li>
<li>Master frames provide broad interpretive schemas at the outset of the cycle. </li>
<li>Frames that are used early on constrain what can be said later on</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This is an interesting point because it is a dynamic argument, and it brings back the interactive part of the argument.  </li>
</ol>
