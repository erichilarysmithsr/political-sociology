<h1>Althusser, Louis. 1970. "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses."</h1>

<h2>Section from EOW 621 paper</h2>

<p>Althusser, in his "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses," wants to explore how a society continues to exist.  To do so, it must reproduce, and the central objects of reproduction that Althusser identifies are its relations of production and forces of production.  Summarized briefly, the forces of production - the means of production and labor power - are reproduced by the production process itself and wages , respectively.  The reproduction of the relations of production is the primary focus of Althusser's exposition, however.  This reproduction, he answers, is guaranteed by ideology.</p>

<p>Althusser's theory of ideology can be subdivided into three issues: (1) the functions of ideology, (2) the processes of ideology, and (3) the mechanisms of ideology (Wright, Lecture 19).  Briefly, (1) is discussed in the previous paragraph, and (2) entails a discussion of state apparatuses, specifically Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs).  I will only provide a treatment of the mechanisms of ideology here.  Althusser notes early on that the discussion here focuses on the category of ideology, not specific ideologies.  With this in mind, he proclaims that ideology has "no history," that, as a category, ideology is immutable and transhistorical.  Althusser, then, following Marx, characterizes ideology as an "imaginary assemblage," the mental residuals left over from the individual's engagement with the material world.  He summarizes this in two theses:</p>

<p>(1) Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence.
(2) Ideology has a material existence.</p>

<p>Put another way, ideology is constructed by the mental residuals left over from the subjects' interaction with the material, and since subjects exist in a material world, those mental residuals have real impacts on the world.  Althusser summarizes this as such: "the existence of the ideas of his belief is material in that his ideas are his material actions inserted into material practices governed by material rituals which are themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which derive the ideas of that subject."  He notes that "material" in each sense refers to a different "modality."  I think that "material actions" and "material practices" mean material in the sense of individual action and even the act of conscious cognition.  "Material rituals" and "material ideological apparatus" allude to more of an objective reality, of structures such as ISAs and culture, and possibly similar to Bourdieu's habitus .</p>

<p>Interpellation is the most salient concept of Althusser's mechanisms of ideology.  The central thesis of the theory of interpellation states simply that ideology interpellates individuals as subjects.  Althusser likens the process of interpellation as being "hailed," as in being called to by a police officer or a friend.  The process of interpellation has the character of "recruiting" or "transforming" individuals to subjects.  However, using the terminology "recruit" or "transform" mischaracterizes the process, since it retains a temporal dimension.  Althusser holds that individuals are "already-always" interpellated as subjects, that even before they are born they have been constituted as subjects by ideology, since ideology is eternal.  The individual, once born, may take on a specific ideology shared by its family; however, the individual always will be interpellated as a subject.   </p>

<p>A last note on interpellation discusses the intentional double entendre of Althusser's use of the word "subject."  Ideology "hails" the individual as a subject in two ways: first, as a subject in the sense of a self-conscious, reflexive, and conscious being, and second, as a subject as an object of subjugation, as the subject of a higher power, such as the King, or God.  This duality is noted more concisely in one of Althusser's summary points: "the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects' recognition of each other, and finally the subject's recognition of himself."  Wright believes that the introduction of this duality is an oblique way of saying that the process of interpellation is structured around a "unifying principle," that each subject is interpellated by some dominating entity, which, in class society, is the rule of the ruling class (Lecture 19).</p>
