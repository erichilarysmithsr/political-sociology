<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>How to analyze collective action and the achievement of collective goods. </li>
<li>Basic argument of collective action is made possible the co-occurrence of individuals' interest and group identity by, first, producing a shared representation of the collective good, and, second, inducing a consistent course of action.</li>
<li>This chapter focuses on the relation of common interest and identity, and collective action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Beyond the free rider
<ul>
<li>Trying to understand the emergence and transformation of collective interests and identities.</li>
<li>The overlap between individual and collective interest which makes collective action possible is the by-product of the emergence of collective identities from patterns of social interaction.</li>
<li>In the case of extraordinary forms the definition of what becomes the public good is likely to be the endogenous production of the collective action itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The origin of shared interests and collective identities
<ul>
<li>In collective action, what constitutes interest is a by-product of the mobilization itself (Calhoun 1991)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conflict, interpersonal influence, and network structure
<ul>
<li>It is also possible that actors will not gain from the attainment of a collective good, or they will gain more from the pursuit of alternative goods.</li>
</ul></li>
