<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>US as being central in systematic studies of the links between democracy and civil society. </li>
<li>Looking at evidence of the quality of public and the performance of social institutions as influenced by norms and networks of civic engagement. </li>
<li>Looking at the influence of social networks as well - Making Democracy Work as showing how networks encourage engagement.</li>
<li>"social capital" - features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit. </li>
<li>Purpose of this piece - to survey trends of social capital in contemporary America. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whatever happened to civic engagement?
<ul>
<li>Much lower levels of political participation within the last generation, and less trust in government.</li>
<li>Possibly a strictly political explanations, but there may be other ones as well.</li>
<li>GSS shows steady decline in organizational membership, including churches, labor unions, PTAs, and, naturally, bowling leagues.</li>
<li><em>Countertrends</em> - new organizations like Sierra Club and NOW. However, these organizations are very different -- members on "paper" and do not attend many, if any, meetings. Growing prominence of nonprofit organizations. 
<ul>
<li>Third trend - expansion in "support groups" of many sorts. However, small groups may not be fostering the community that their proponents say they do. Very "hands off"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Good neighborliness and social trust
<ul>
<li>Most fundamental form of social capital is the family, and there is evidence of loosening of bonds within the family.</li>
<li>Decline of connections between neighbors. </li>
<li>Americans as also less trusting. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why is US social capital eroding?
<ul>
<li>Possible explanations
<ul>
<li><em>Movement of women into the labor force</em> - possible that this is one reason that this has taken time away from building social capital.</li>
<li><em>Mobility: the "re-potting" hypothesis</em> - Suburbanization, movement to Sun Belt as disrupting processes of social capital.</li>
<li><em>Other demographic transformations</em> - shift in American family - fewer marriages, more divorces, fewer children, lower real wages.</li>
<li><em>Technological transformation of leisure</em> - More consumption of television, Internet.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is to be done?
<ul>
<li>Need to sort out the dimensions of social capital</li>
<li>What are macrosocial currents that might intersect with trends described here?</li>
<li>Should also consider the costs as well as the benefits of community engagement.</li>
<li>How does public policy impinge on social-capital formation? </li>
</ul></li>
