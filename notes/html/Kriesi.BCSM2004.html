<ol>
<li>Introduction 
<ul>
<li>PPM is confusing as all get out.</li>
<li>In this chapter, an attempt to clarify it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The general framework of the political process approach
<ul>
<li>PPM is a framework for the study of social movements. It is a general conceptual toolkit that helps analysts to generate the questions that need to be addressed in the study of social movements and to delimit the field of research. </li>
<li>Frameworks have heuristic function but they do not yet provide explanations or predictions.</li>
<li>Models, on the other hand, make precise assumptions about a limited set of parameters and variations. They allow for testing of specific parts of the theory.</li>
<li>Kriesti presents the framework distinguishing between three sets of variables -- structures, configurations of power, and interaction contexts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Structures
<ul>
<li>Political opportunity structures (POS) is what could be called the hard core of PPM. POS influence the choice of protest strategies and the impact of SM on their environment.</li>
<li>Core of structures made up of formal political institutions.</li>
<li>Also including cultural models for political-cultural or symbolic opportunities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configurations of actors 
<ul>
<li>Three classes: protagonists, antagonists, and bystanders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interaction context
<ul>
<li>Level of the mechanisms linking structures and configurations to agency and action. This is the level at which the strategies of the social movements and their opponents come into view.</li>
</ul></li>
