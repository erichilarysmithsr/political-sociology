<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Sociologists have mostly ignored ongoing problems and strategic
dilemmas of social movements.</li>
<li>Resource mobilization (RM) as taking seriously questions that have
concerned SM leaders and practictioners.</li>
<li>RM emphasizes societal support and constraint of SM phenomena. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perspectives emphasizing deprivation and beliefs
<ul>
<li>RD as providing most influence. </li>
<li>However, not a lot of support for relationship between
objective/subjective deprivation and outbreaks of movements.</li>
<li>Moving the idea of grievances as a secondary consideration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resource mobilizaton
<ul>
<li>Focusing on Olson's provocation, explaining SMs requires
attention to selection of incentives, cost-reudcing mechanisms or
strctures, and career benefits that lead to collective behavior.</li>
<li>Emphasize on: aggregation of resources (money and
labor). Aggregation requires some minimal form of organization,
thus focusing on SMOs. Necessary to focus on involvement of
individuals and orgs from outside the SMO. Supply and demand of
org resources; costs and rewards in explaining individual and org
involvement. </li>
<li>Compare with traditional model:
<ol>
<li>Support base: <em>Traditional</em> - SMs are based on aggrieved
populations; <em>RM</em> - SMs are based on conscience constituents who
may not be aggrieved themselves.</li>
<li>Strategy and tactics: <em>Traditional</em> - SM leaders use
bargaining, persuasion or violence to influence authorities. <em>RM</em> -
SMOs adopt a number of strategic tasks.</li>
<li>Relation to larger society: <em>Traditional</em> - Mostly ignored
focus on external environment, since no focus on SMOs. <em>RM</em> -
society provides the infrastructure which SMOs utilize. </li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theoretical elements
<ul>
<li><em>social movement</em> - set of opinions and beliefs in a population
which represents preferences for changing some elements of the
social structure and/or reward distribution of a society.</li>
<li><em>countermovement</em> - that which runs opposed to the SM</li>
<li><em>SMO</em> - formal organization which identifies its goals with
preferences of a social movement or countermovement and attempts
to implement those goals.</li>
<li><em>social movement industry (SMI)</em> - all SMOs which have as their
goal the broadest preferences of a SM</li>
<li><em>social movement sector (SMS)</em> - all SMIs in a soiety no matter
to which SM they are attached. </li>
<li><em>target goals</em> - set of preferred changes toward which it claims
to be working. </li>
<li><em>adherents</em> - individuals and orgs that believe in the goals of
the SM.</li>
<li><em>constituents</em> - those providing resources for the SMO.</li>
<li>At one level the RM task is converting adherents into constiuents
and maintaining constituent involvement. Also turning
nonadherents into adherents. </li>
<li>Mass and elites control different amounts of resources. </li>
<li>Turning nonadherents into adherents relies on how many resources
an SMO can marshall.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The elements applied: illustrative hypotheses
<ul>
<li>Resources, the SMS, and the growth of SMIs.
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis 1: As the amount of discretionary resources of mass
and elite publics increases, the absolute and relativ eamount
of resources available to the SMS increases.</li>
<li>Hypothesis 2: The greater the absolute amount of resources
available to the SMS the greater the likelihood that new SMIs
and SMOs will develop to compete for these resources. </li>
<li>Hypothesis 3: Regardless of the resources available to
potential beneficiary adherents, the larger the amount of
resources avaiable to conscience adherents the more likely is
the development of SMOs and SMIs that respond to preferences
for change. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organization structure and resource mobilization
<ul>
<li>How do competitive positions of the SMS, processes within an
SMI, and the structure of an SMO influence the task of RM?</li>
<li>Federated and islated structure - federation serves to organize
constituents into small local units. </li>
<li>Hypothesis 4: The more an SMO is dependent upon isolated
consitutents the less stable will be the flow of resources to
the SMO. </li>
<li>Possible to suggest that advertising can convince isolated
adherents. Media mediate relation between isolated constituents
and SMOs.</li>
<li>Hypothesis 4a: The more dependent an SMO is upon isolated
constituents the greater the share of its resources which will
be allocated to advertising.</li>
<li>Hypothesis 4b: The more an SMO depends upon isolated
constituents to maintain a resource flow the more its shifts in
resource flow resemble the patterns of consumer expenditures
for expendable and marginal goods.</li>
<li>Hypothesis 5: An SMO which attempts to link both conscience and
beneficiary constituents to the organization through federated
chapter structures, and hence solidary incentives, is likely to
have high levels of tension and conflict. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rates of resource fluctuation and SMO adaption
<ul>
<li>What are the implications of larger or smaller resource flows
for the fate of SMOs for careers in social movements, and for
the use of different types of constitutencies?</li>
<li>Hypothesis 6: Older, established SMOs are more likely than
newer SMOs to persist throughout the cycle of SMI growth and
decline. </li>
<li>Hypothesis 7: The more competitive an SMI the more likely it is
that new SMOs will offer narrow goals and strategies.</li>
<li>Hypothesis 8: The larger the income flow to an SMO the more
likely that cadre and staff are professional and the larger are
these groups [... duh?]</li>
<li>Hypothesis 9: The large the SMS and the larger the specific
SMIs themor elikely it is that SM careers will develop.</li>
<li>Hypothesis 10: The more an SMO is funded by isolated
constituents the more likely that beneficiary constituent
workers are recruited for strategic purposes rather than for
orgnaizational work. </li>
<li>Hypothesis 11: The more a SMO is made up of workers with
discretionary time at their disposal the more readily it can
develop transitory teams. </li>
