<h2>Notes from Emirbayer's seminar, Spring 2012</h2>

<ol>
<li>Marx's distinction between civil society and the state
<ul>
<li>What does Marx mean by civil society and the state?
<ol>
<li>For Marx, there is a historic process in which feudal society turns into bourgeois society, then divides into civil society and the state.</li>
<li>Civil society is characterized by brutish, atomized individuals
<ul>
<li>Realm of production - like the world of Adam Smith</li>
<li>Realm of private interests and differentiation </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Political society
<ul>
<li>Characterized by general interests</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rights are divided into the rights of man and the rights of the citizen
<ul>
<li>Rights of the citizen are defending against those egoist, civil society features</li>
<li>The bourgeois man is effectively an egoist and the rights of the citizen and political life are the means towards securing the rights of man</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What Marx would aim for is a world where there is a rectification of those two spheres, of civil society and political life
<ul>
<li>The lip service given to universality and citizenship he considers a sham.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distinction of political and human emancipation
<ul>
<li>Overcoming the divide between political society and civil society</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
