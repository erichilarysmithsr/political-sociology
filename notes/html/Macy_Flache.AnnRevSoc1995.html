<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Efforts to bring the gap between structure and action with formal microsocial theories that constrain choice but preserve agency.</li>
<li>Wanting to expand microeconomic theory to other sorts of exchange. </li>
<li>Focusing on other forms of societal constraint on individual choice.</li>
<li>Two strains of theory that have emerged - network exchange theory and evolutionary models of collective action. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Network exchange: from macro to micro and back
<ul>
<li><em>structural analysis and social exchange</em> 
<ul>
<li>Network exchange theory (NET) - focuses on distribution of power in a network of social ties that limit opportunities for exchange. 
<ul>
<li>attempts to integrate systematically the structural embeddedness of actors into choice-driven explanations of both individual behavior and effects of structure on outcomes. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>social exchange theory - modeling social relations as mutually profitable resource transfers conducted by self-interested actors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>collective action and exchange structure</em>
<ul>
<li>NET had been untied to the larger RCT lit on social dilemmas and collective action. Ignores problem of free riding and being suckered.</li>
<li>Collection action (CA) lit has generally ignored structure of social ties among members of the interest group.</li>
<li>Yamagishi and Cook (1993) distinguished between "generalized exchange" of CA and "restricted exchanged" of NET. Call it "network-generalized exchange"
<ul>
<li>Considers fully rational action and other, extra-rational considerations. </li>
<li>"group-generalized exchange" may look like an n-person PD, while "network-generalized exchange" may look like an n-person assurance game. Therefore higher cooperation in network-generalized than in group-generalized exchange structures. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, Marwell and Oliver argue that group-generalized problems can be resolved with heterogeneous goods and nonlinear production functions and jointness of supply.
<ul>
<li>They also show how successful collective action can benefit from centralized ties that facilitate "selectivity" by organizers -- the identification and mobilization of a few key contributors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gould extends this by adding normative pressure to the rational influence of vanguard contributors.
<ul>
<li>Network centralization affects total contributions because of the competing influences of volunteers and shirkers trying to match the average contribution of their peers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>emergent social structure</em>
<ul>
<li>Looking at social structure as endogenous rather than exogenous constraint on behavior. </li>
<li>Applying NET to include strategic manipulation of network linkages.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The explanatory power of unintended consequences
<ul>
<li>Evolutionary models are consequentialist -- outcomes are used to explain the actions that bring them about.</li>
<li>In RCT, intentionality is the mechanism by which consequences can solicit the actions that produce them, bringing the future to bear on the present. </li>
<li>But in evolutionary theory, we have to see what produced the outcome. It is not usually intentionality. 
<ul>
<li>"Repetition, not intention, that brings the future to bear on the present.... the optimizing process if backward-looking, not forward-looking; evolutionary, not analytic."</li>
<li>Two types of environmental feedback:
<ul>
<li>Reproduction, which alters the frequency distribution of strategies within a population of actions</li>
<li>Reinforcement, which alters the probability distribution of strategies within the repertoire of each individual.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This moves the focus away from calculus of marginal utility and towards evolution of hard-wired cultural codes, including pragmatic or heuristic routines, social conventions, institutionalized rituals, moral habits, and normative rules.</li>
<li>Study of cooperation in social dilemmas, in evolutionary game theory. Tit-for-tat gains the best competitive advantage. (Axelrod 1984)</li>
<li>In PD situations, one is generally not a prison. Exit is an option. </li>
<li><em>Cultural evolution and kin altruism</em> - how does culture play a role in these models?
<ul>
<li>possible that kin altruism extends to those with shared identities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Learning and imitation as evolutionary mechanisms</em> - "If a rule or routine brings about a satisfactory result, continue to follow it."
<ul>
<li>Focusing on role modeling or social learning. </li>
<li>Coordination is easier if actors look around to see what others are doing before deciding to participate. </li>
