<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>The question of the rise of democracy has been largely left to
political philosophers. The discussion, however, leaves out
systematic comparison between all available cases. </li>
<li>The discussion also has to do with the use of different
definitions of democracy.
<ul>
<li>For this paper: a political system which supplies regular
constitutional opportunities for changing the governing
officials. It is a social mechanism for the resolution of the
problem of societal decision-mkaing among conflicting interest
groups which permits the largest possible part of the
population to influence these decisions through their ability
to choose among alternative contenders for political
office. (71)</li>
<li>This implies (a) a system of beliefs that are legitimized; b) a
set of political leaders in office; and c) one or more sets of
leaders out of office who act as a legitimate opposition
attempting to gain office. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Considering here two characteristics of social systems --
economic develop and legitimacy. </li>
<li>We shouldn't expect a correlation between income, education,
religion, and democracy on theoretical grounds, because those
elements which the political form may persist may not be
conducive to its emergence. </li>
<li>Unique events may account for either the persistence or failure
of democracy. </li>
<li>Comparative generalizations must necessarily deal with particular
historical features of any one society withint he scope of
investigation. </li>
<li>Separating out the European and Latin American countries because
of historical particularities. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Economic development and democracy
<ul>
<li>Widespread generalization is that democracy is linked to
economic development. </li>
<li>We do see that indeed, this is the case, for measures of wealth,
industrialization, urbanization, and education. </li>
<li>Public opinion firms have found that single most important
predictor of democracy has been education. </li>
<li>Education as sustaining and creating belief in democracy norms.</li>
<li>One aspect of the education relationship is that advancement
proceeds through gradual progress, not extremist ones.</li>
<li>Increased wealth changes social conditions of workers, but also
affects the political role of the middle class.  </li>
<li>National income as related to political values and style of the
upper class -- they will not treat lower class as part of the
country.</li>
<li>National income also affects receptivity to democratic political
tolerance norms. Will not matter if there is an opposition party
in power. </li>
<li>National income related to presence of intermediary organizations
and institutions which can act as sources of countervailing
power -- idea of civil society in Tocqueville. Can act as a
source of alternative opinions and mediate participation in
politics. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Legitimacy and democracy
<ul>
<li>Stability of a democracy depends on effectiveness and legitimacy
of the political system. </li>
<li>Effectiveness as the actual performance of a political system,
extent to which it satisfies the basic functions of government as
defined by the expectations of most members of a society.</li>
<li>Legitimacy regards capacity of a political system to engender and
maintain the belief that the existing political institutions are
the more appropriate or proper ones for society.</li>
<li>In this paper, showing how the degree of legitimacy of a
democratic syste may affect its capacity to survive the crises of
effectiveness; and second, to indicate the ways in which the
different resolutions of basic historical cleavages also strength
or weaken democracy.</li>
<li>Effectiveness is primarily instrumental, while legitimacy is more
affective and evaluative. </li>
<li>Legitimacy can be maintained for a variety of political systems,
including oppressive ones. Crises of legitimacy are rather
recent, often concomitant with rise of mass communication systems.</li>
<li>Crisis of legitimacy can also arise during transition to new
social structure -- either all major groups do not secure access
to the politicalsystem early; or the status of major conservative
institutions is threatened during the transition.</li>
<li>Note the move to democratic regimes in states that still
consider themselves monarchies. 
<ul>
<li>Thus, one main source of legitimacy lies in the continuity of
primary conservative and integrative institutions during a
transitional period in which new social institutions are
emerging.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Major test of legitimacy is the extent to which nations have
developed a common "secular political culture" -- national
rituals, holidays, which maintain the legitimacy of various
democratic practices. </li>
<li>Four-fold table -- +/i on two dimensions: effectiveness and
legitimacy
<ul>
<li>From the short-range view, an effective but illegitimate system
is more unstable than regimes which are low in effectiveness
and high in legitimacy. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Legitimacy and cleavage</em> - Inherent in all democratic systems is
the constant threat that conflicts amongst different groups may
crystallize to a point in which societal integration falls
apart. Thus one needs conditions to moderate the intensity of
partisan battle.</li>
<li>Three major issues as emerging in Western states - the plac of
the church within the nation; the problem of admission of the
lower strata to citizenship; and the struggle over the
distribution of national income. 
<ul>
<li>Were these dealt one-by-one or did the problems accumulate?</li>
<li>Seems like they were dealt with differently in different
countries. </li>
<li><em>Weltanschauung</em> politics as weakening the possibility for a
stable demoacy -- actions are based on the assumption that is
important to isolate their followers from contact with
"falsehood" expressed by non-believers.</li>
<li>When there is more diversity in political leanings then
individuals will be less suseptible to politically extreme
beliefs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stable democracy requires relatively moderate tension among
political contenders. </li>
<li>Political moderation is facilitated by capacity of a system to
resolve key dividing issues before new ones arise. </li>
<li>In short, there is rough correlation between
modernization/economic development and democracy, but cleavages
can effect different electoral and constitutional arrangements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Systems of government and democracy
<ul>
<li>Follows that two-party systems are better than multi-party
systems, electoral systems based on territorial basis are
preferable to systems of proportional representation, and that
federalism is better than a unitary state.</li>
<li>But variation here matters less than what has been outlined above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Problems of contemporary democracy
<ul>
<li>Pattern of stable Western democracies is when there is little
difference between democractic left and right, so-called
"post-politics" phase. </li>
<li>Workers have won their fight for political and economic
citizenship. 
<ul>
<li>However, presence of Communists as preventing integration.  </li>
</ul></li>
