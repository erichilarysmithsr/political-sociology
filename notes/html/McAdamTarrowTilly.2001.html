<h1>Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly. 2001. <em>Dynamics of Contention</em>.</h1>

<h2>Ch. 1 - What are they yelling about?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Contentious politics
<ul>
<li>Contentious politics as showing how different forms of
contentious - SM, revolutions, etc - result from similar
mechanisms and processes.</li>
<li>Definition: episodic, public, collective interaction among makers
of claims and their objects when (a) at least one government is a
claimant, an object of claims, or a party to the claims and (b)
the claims would, if realized, affect the interestsoof at least
one of the claimants
<ul>
<li>This definition attempts to unite what are similar instances of
contention due to shared mechanisms and processes.</li>
<li>Also attempts to remove the boundary between institutionalized
and noninstitutionalized politics. Many instances of
noninstitutional contention emerge from institutional
contention.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contained and transgressive contention
<ul>
<li><em>Contained</em> - cases in which all parties are previously
established actors employing well-established means of claim
making. </li>
<li><em>Transgressive</em> - at least some parties to the conflict are newly
self-identified politics actors and/or at least some parties
employ innovative collective action. This book mostly focuses on
this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What's news?
<ul>
<li>Identiyfing similarities and differences, pathways and
trajectories across a wide range of contentious politics. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>From polity model to dynamics of contention
<ul>
<li>How to identify actors in contentious politics, their claims, the
objects of those claims, and responses to claim making. </li>
<li>Two simplifications:
<ul>
<li>Polity model includes agents of government, polity members,
challengers, subjects, and outside political actors.</li>
<li>Political actors as sets of individuals and relations among
persons whose internal organization and connections with
other political actors maintain substaintial continuity in
time and space. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moving to dynamic analysis
<ul>
<li>Social processes as sequences and combinations of causal
mechanisms.</li>
<li>To explain contentious politics is to identify recurrent causal
mechanisms, the ways they combine, in what sequences they
recur, adn why different combinations and sequences, starting
from different initial conditions, produce varying effects on
the large scale.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Classic social movement agenda
<ul>
<li>Attention of the social movement scholars on political
opportunities, mobilizing structures, collective action frames,
and repertoires of contention (the culturally encoded ways in
which people interact in contentious politics) </li>
<li>Interaction between these served as the generic rubric for SM
studies. However this worked less when it came to nondemocratic
states and highlighted dynamic movements. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intellectual resources
<ul>
<li>Structuralist, rationalist, phenomoenological (individual, identity),
cultural (structural and ideational) </li>
<li>Relational - thinking about interpersonal networks, interpersonal
communication, and various forms of continuous negotiation as
figuring centrally in the dyanmics of contention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Causal mechanisms, causal processes, contentious episodes
<ul>
<li>mechanisms - a delimited class of events that alter relations
among specified sets of elements in identical or closely similar
ways over a variety of situations.</li>
<li>processes - regular sequences of such mechanisms that produce
similar transformations of those elements</li>
<li>episodes - continous streams of contention incluing collective
claims making that bears on other parties' interests</li>
<li>environmental, cognitive, and relational mechanisms (akin to how
Tilly (2003) describes them.</li>
<li>episodes as composed of several different processes.</li>
<li>task, then, is the following:
<ul>
<li>identifying contentious episodes or families of contentious
episodes having some problematic feature</li>
<li>locating the processes within them that constitute or produce
the problematic feature</li>
<li>searching out the crucial causal mechanisms within those
processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to delineate an episode? Depends on observers' lenses, how
they name it.</li>
<li>Mechanisms and processes as workhorses of explanation, while
episodes are that of description.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mobilization, Actors, Trajectories <br />
<ul>
<li>mobilization - explain how people who are not making contentious
claims begin to do so.</li>
<li>actors - explain what sorts of actors engage in contentioun, what
identities they assume, and what forms of interaction they
produce.</li>
<li>trajectories - explaining the course and transofmraiton of
contention.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
