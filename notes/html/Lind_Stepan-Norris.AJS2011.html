<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Many studies have focused on resources, infrastructure, and
leadership for social movements, but few have focused on
relationality of movements and countermovements.</li>
<li>Focusing on those elements of both movements and
countermovements.</li>
<li>Spatial analysis to determine which enhanced renter mobilization
in LA. </li>
<li>Why did different subsections of the city respond with varying
levels of mobilization?</li>
<li>Moving beyond literature in two ways: 
<ol>
<li>emphasizing relationality of movements by looking at factors
involved with movement mobilization and considering
infrastructure and leadership of the counter movement.</li>
<li>Incorporate the role of geographical space into social
movement infrastructure through both organizational network ties
and geographic advantage of location and proximity.  </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Do this by using historical case study design with quant data
from survey, sociodemographic, and spatial sources. </li>
<li>Trying to focus on local-level movements to avoid national-level
bias in SM studies. </li>
<li><em>Resources</em>
<ul>
<li>expecting that labor and student participant to e
msot beneficial for retners' mobilization. Monetary resources of
individuals as having an upper limit. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Infrastructure</em> -- Infrastructure as multiple organizations and
network ties that cross spatial, racial/ethnic, or class
boundaries.
<ul>
<li>addressing Brieger duality between neighborhoods as formed by
mutal organizational presence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Leadership</em> -- influences goals, strategies, organizational
structures, and interactions with others. 
<ul>
<li>renter activists' "strategic capacity" should be stronger with
more strong/weak ties and where renter populations overlap with
groups more experienced in other SM areas. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Countermovements
<ul>
<li>need to understand infrastructure and strategic capacity of the
"countermovement"</li>
<li>emphasize the relationality of movements and countermovements. </li>
<li>by nature of property ownership, each member of the landlord
organization has considerably more recourses than members of the
renter organization. </li>
<li>analyze how countermovement leaders and organizational centrality
deter renter movement mobilization</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data
<ul>
<li>Measuring "rent control" mentions from newspaper data as a proxy
for mobilization.</li>
<li>Cross-sectional random sample telephone survey of LA tenants</li>
<li>Archival records of speakers on rent control at LA City Council
meetings</li>
<li>Neighborhood level demographic data from the census</li>
<li>Newsletters of largest pro-tenant organization. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>The sample
<ul>
<li>To measure mobilization, use the number of tenant activists
within each zip code in 1979, give the number of tenant
nonactivists within the same zip code.</li>
<li>An artifact of the random-sampling made it such that the higher
number of tenants in an area, the more likely there would be an
activist there. </li>
<li>To account for this, using a "two-column" logisitic regresion -
dependent variable may include multiple binomial trials. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Measurement of independent variables
<ul>
<li>percentage of renters from census</li>
<li><em>resources</em> - % college grads, % of tenants who belonged to labor
unions, median household income. </li>
<li><em>infrastructure</em> - five indicators: geographical distance to
other parts of LA; number of orgs representing tenants interests
with active members in the locale; neighborhood centrality of
these organizations; number of organizations representing
landlord interests; neighborhood centrality of landlord orgs. 
<ul>
<li>organizations in locales -- number of protenant/prolandlord
movement orgs with one or more participants in city council
meetings.</li>
<li>from this, constructing neighborhood ties as common membership
in tenants'/landlords' organizations -- turning into one-mode
data, then measuring degree centrality for each zip code. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>leadership</em> - absolute number of peoplpe who spoke at City
Council meetings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results and analysis
<ul>
<li>On average, most zip codes don't have any tenant
activists. Leadership is a relative rare phenomenon. </li>
<li>Unionization and college grads as positive and significant. </li>
<li>Average distance to other LA zip codes as negative and
significant.</li>
<li>neighborhood organizational centrality of landlords suppresses
tenant mobilization. however, same measure for tenant
organizations is not significant. 
<ul>
<li>effect of protenant neighborhood centrality actually recedes
after accounting for counter-movement infrastructure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>leadership for tenants fails to be significant, although
is significant for landlords. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusions
<ul>
<li>They demonstrate the extent tow hich the relationality of social
movements and countermovements must be considered. </li>
<li>Infrastructure matters.</li>
<li>When countermovements have strong centrality, their impact on
decreasng mobilization is greater. Could be due to
interorganizational communication and breath of available
information. </li>
<li>This builds on Gould 1991 by extending it for the respective
countermovement. </li>
<li>Number of leaders matter for landlords but not for tenants. </li>
</ul></li>
