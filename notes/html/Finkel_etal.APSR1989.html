<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>How to incorporate the grievance and the RCT models of collective action?</li>
<li>It is possible that personal belief in efficacy could actual produce the public good.</li>
<li>Preferences could produce expected benefits through interactions with beliefs -- "collective rationality." Individuals adhere to the "useful fiction" that unity is necessary for group success. Similarly, they may all adhere to some moral duty to participate. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Public goods and collective action: alternative models
<ul>
<li>Simple grievance model - public good preferences as autonomous cause of protest.</li>
<li>Rational choice model - incorporates the probability of success without the individual (p_n) and the probability that the individual's contribution will matter (p_i)</li>
<li>p_n will approximate 1, while p_i will approximate zero.</li>
<li>How to solve the logic of free-riding: 
<ul>
<li>first solution relax the assumption that the p_i =~ 0. People usually expect that their individual contribution matters.</li>
<li>Second solution - individuals act on the basis of general strategic or ethical beliefs that promote "collective rationality"
<ul>
<li>Source of this belief - individuals asking "what if everyone did that?" from both a strategic and a moral point of view.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Research design
<ul>
<li>Survey of nationally representative sample of W. Germany in 1987-88; representative samples of two communities where protest is common.</li>
<li>Variables on legal and illegal protest, policy dissatisfaction, perceived likelihood of group success, personal influence, belief in the unity principle, duty to participate, and collective rationality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results
<ul>
<li>Bivariate correlation shows evidence of policy dissatisfaction, perceptions of group success, personal influence, and beliefs promoting collective rationality as significantly related to both illegal and legal protest.</li>
<li>Grievance model predicts legal and illegal protest, but has low R^2.</li>
<li>Personal influence model is also strong, and has higher R^2.</li>
<li>Collective rationality model is also supported, but is not much more than personal influence.</li>
<li>Bottom line: given moderate-to-high levels of policy dissatisfaction, the more perceptions of likelihood of group success are coupled with either the belief in the unity or in a duty to participate, the greater the likelihood that the individual will join a collective legal protest.</li>
