<h1>Robert Putnam et al. 1993. <em>Making Democracy Work</em></h1>

<h2>Notes from Ermakoff's class, Fall 2010</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Study design</p>

<ul>
<li>Putnam's measures of performance
<ul>
<li>set of indicators that measure efficiency</li>
<li>set that measure responsiveness in policy</li>
<li>set that measure policy implementation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the goal is to measure how well a democracy operates, only the second set is relevant</li>
<li>The other two sets are about government institutional efficiency
and output which has little to do with a particular form of
government.       </li>
<li>How to measure civicness
<ul>
<li>Civic engagement; political equality; norms of solidarity,
trust, and tolerance;  strong associational life.              </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Four empirical criteria
<ul>
<li>How much participation there is in associations</li>
<li>Newspaper circulation</li>
<li>Election turnout</li>
<li>Preference voting (the more preference voting is used, the less civic the polity and more indicative of patronage politics)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major finding</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a major correlation between performance and civicness    </li>
<li>We should ask ourselves, how apt is the research design for
measuring what they claim they are doing      </li>
<li>Since there is such a high correlation, we should ask whether
indicators on both sides are measuring different things.      </li>
<li>The preference voting indicator is measuring not only a social
practice but also an institutional facet      </li>
<li>It is at the cross-section of the two realms that we are trying to measure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Is this a new argument? No.</p>

<ul>
<li>Montesquieu makes the same point.</li>
<li>Forms of government are correlated with the types of political culture, shared cultural orientations.</li>
<li>This argument went through a revival in the 1960s.</li>
<li>Almond and Verba. 1963. <em>Civic Culture</em>.
<ul>
<li>Surveyed people in five different countries and asked how proud they were about political instittuions;
could change policy, and could trust their peers.</li>
<li>highly informed by Tocqueville's concept of democracy.</li>
<li>Found that there was a significant difference between cases. The US and Britain had high civic culture, Italy and Germany
did not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Putnam is building on this argument since Almond and Verba are
saying explicitly that <em>culture determines democracy</em>.      </li>
<li>Problem is that they ask people about this at only one point in
time. Putnam overcomes this by taking longitudinal data.      </li>
<li>Putnam is also much more methodologically pluralistic; it is set
up to be experimental.     </li>
<li>He pays attention ot the theoretical underpinnings of the
argument. The micro causal mechanisms that account for micro
effectiveness and civicness - the reference to social capital is
central here.</li>
<li><em>Social capital</em> - the extensiveness of social ties and the norms of reciprocity.
<ul>
<li>The higher each of these, the higher social capital</li>
<li>The concept is drawn from J.S. Coleman. "The pope of
rational choice" <em>Foundations of Social Theory</em> 1990.          </li>
<li>Response to the individualist notion of the human of the Chicago School of neoliberalist economics.</li>
<li>Coleman wanted to draw attentionto the ability of people to draw in the social ties as resources,
thus it does form a sort of capital.</li>
<li>This concept comes from Glenn Loury.</li>
<li>Family background contributes to educational achievement, knowledge attainment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Putnam is new in drawing in reciprocity to the idea of social capital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Critiques </p>

<ul>
<li>The way he is describing the ways ties are structured are more
conducive to social capital.  But at the same time, he is
considering beliefs and orientations.
<ul>
<li>He is conflating structure and culture; the concept social capital is thus very heterogenous.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The notion of benefiting from norms and reciprocity is rather undertheorized.
<ul>
<li>Interpersonal trust is necessary for secondary association, which is key for civic culture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternative explanation: economic wealth produces a more efficient government and produces civic society.
<ul>
<li>He handles this by disaggregating regions into the North and South.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Within each quadrant (p. 85) one cannot explain performance vs. modernity
<ul>
<li>When he includes civicness as an independent variable, the modernity variable becomes insignificant.
But he doesn't do the opposite, i.e. regress modernity on civicness and performance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The way Putnam conceives of historical causality is problematic and highly deterministic.
<ul>
<li>Over 500 years the historical culture remains the same and it causes something in the 1970s?</li>
<li>History is much more contingent and conditional. There needs to be an explication of how institutions
have lasted that long.   </li>
</ul></li>

<h3>Ch. 1 - Introduction: Studying Institutional Performance</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Understanding of the performance of democratic institutions</p>

<ul>
<li>What do they depend on?</li>
<li>Change in handling of public issues to new regional governments
from national government in 1970. <br />
<ul>
<li>Study on how well new institutions responded to constitutents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the conditions for creating storng, responsive,
effective representative institutions?      </li>
<li>A natural experiment - new regional governments established
simultaneously in 1970, but the social, economic, political, and
cultural contexts in which they were implemented differed
dramatically.      </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Charting the voyage</p>

<ul>
<li>Principles of new institutionalism:
<ol>
<li>Institutions shape politics - they influence outcomes because they shape actors' identities, power, and strategies.</li>
<li>Institutions are shaped by history</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Using institutions as independent variable, how institutional change affects the identities, power, and strategies of political
actors.</li>
<li>Then, using institutions as a dependent variable, how institutional performance is shaped by history.</li>
<li>A third step: how performance of institutions is shaped by social context.
<ul>
<li>Asking which factors of social context matter most for institutional performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three approaches to explain institutional performance:
<ol>
<li>institutional design (Mill, Ostrom)</li>
<li>socioeconomic (modernization thesis - Lipset, Dahl)</li>
<li>political cultural (civic culture - Almond and Verba, Tocqueville)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Methods</p>

<ul>
<li>Field observation and case study</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis in regression and factor analysis.</li>
<li>History of each region.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Ch. 5 - Tracing the Roots of the Civic Community</h3>

<p>Social patterns of early medieval Italy are decisive in explaining why
some communities are better able to manage collective life and
sustain effective institutions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Civic Legacies of Medieval Italy</p>

<ul>
<li>Regime in the South founded by Norman mercenaries was advanced
administrative and economically, but it was autocratic.
<ul>
<li>Southern towns were bound to networks responsible only to
the king.</li>
<li>This structure would remain essentially unchanged over the
next several centuries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The towns of northern and central Italy were unprecedented in
their forms of government. 
<ul>
<li>Relied more on horizontal organization rather than vertical.</li>
<li>More liberal and egalitarian than in other contemporary
regimes.</li>
<li>networks of associational life and mores of the republics
were analogous to the "civic community".</li>
<li>Authority in written documents, instead of coercion or
familial relations.</li>
<li>Expansion of civic republicanism was tied to an expansion of
commerce. Invention of credit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Public order
<ul>
<li>In the South, protection through the king or the strong
local baron.</li>
<li>In the North, pacts of mutual assistance. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Italy in the 17th century saw descent into feudalism; however
the Northern variant still exhibited some cultural of civic
involvement, social responsibility, and mutual assistance 
[I find this claim to be very poorly supported - cite is only to
two sources]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Civic traditions after unification</p>

<ul>
<li>Continent-wide growth of associational life post-French
revolution</li>
<li>In post-unification Italy, a grouwth of mutual aid societies.</li>
<li>Organizations were non-political but played important latent
political functions. </li>
<li>Political organizations established near the turned of the
century</li>
<li>[Predictably] these organizations differed between the North and
the South - North as one of mutual aid, cross-family ties, etc.,
Sotuh as isolated.</li>
<li>South was indeed also political, but it was about social
connections and patrimonialism.
<ul>
<li>Mafia as an expression of weak state enforcement of laws,
and culture of mistrust.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Measuring the durability of civic traditions</p>

<ul>
<li>They create a measure of civic involvement for 1860-1920 based
on membership in mutual aid societies; membership in
cooperatives; strength of mass parties; turnout in the few
relatively open elections before Fascism brought authoritarian
rule to Italy; and the longevity of local associations.</li>
<li>This measure correlates very well with civic community measure
[seems like these aren't independent of each other though? so it's
not causal. I don't think Putnam would say it is though.]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Economic development and civic traditions</p>

<ul>
<li>Socioeconomic explanations pose an alternative hypothesis for
civic community and institutional performance. </li>
<li>But there's reason to doubt this - economic performance seems to
be the same near the turn of the century.</li>
<li>In fact, it may look like civic traditions are a better
predictor of socioeconomic development.</li>
<li>Union membership followed patterns of civic solidarity rather than
industrialization.
[The claim of Rueschemeyer et al. would reverse the causality here: 
union membership and working-class power makes for more civicness 
and democracy.]    </li>
<li>What are the micro-level interactions that go along with this
macro trend? Norms of reciprocity and networks of civic
engagement. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Ch. 6 - Social Capital and Institutional Success</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>How to over come collective action problems? Possible "soft"
solutions, such as community and trust.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Capital, Trust, and Rotating Credit Associations</p>

<ul>
<li>Overcoming collective action dilemmas depends on social context
in which the game is played. Cooperation is easier in a
community with more social capital.</li>
<li><em>Social capital</em> - features of social organization that can
improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordination
actions.</li>
<li>Rotating credit association as a situation in which trust and
norms of reciprocity are needed.</li>
<li>Social capital allows trust to become transitive and spread. </li>
<li>One can accumulate social capital like conventional capital. But
you can get more the more you spend but may diminish with
disuse.</li>
<li>Social capital is a public good, not a private one. It must be
produced as a by-product of other social activities.</li>
<li>In civic regions of Italy, social trust is major part of the
ethos for economic development and government performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Norms of reciprocity and networks of civic engagement</p>

<ul>
<li>Social trust can arise from two related sources: norms of
reciprocity and networks of civic engagement.</li>
<li>Generalized reciprocity - continuing relationship of trust that
is continually unbalanced but invovles mutual expectations that a
benefit granted now will be repaid in the future.</li>
<li>Norm of generalized reciprocity as important for social capital.</li>
<li>Networks of civic engagement are an essential form of social
capital.
<ul>
<li>These networks increase potental costs to a defector.</li>
<li>They foster robust norms of reciprocity.</li>
<li>Networks of civic enagement faciliate communication and
improve the flow of information about the trustworthiness of
individuals. </li>
<li>Networks of civic engagement embody past success at
collaboration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vertical networks, such in Italy's south,
cannot sustain social trust and cooperation.</li>
<li>This finding is counter the results that say that a strong
society means a weak economy and a weak state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>History and institutional performance: two social equilibria</p>

<ul>
<li>One equilibrium is for no one to cooperate, as expected from a
PD game. Fall back into hierarchical networks, into kinship relationships.</li>
<li>Second equilibrium is that of a "brave reciprocity" in which
there is adequate social capital.</li>
<li>Which equilibrium a society ends up at depends on historical
contingency. It is path dependent.
<ul>
<li>Douglass North attributes this fact to post-colonial
histories of North and South America. North was couched in
civic tradition of parliamentary Britain, South in Latin
centralized authoritarianism and clientelism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We are left with the puzzle - how did civic traditions start in
North and South Italy? This entails further research.</li>
<li>Conclusion - "Social context and history profoundly condition
the effectiveness of institutions." (p. 182)</li>
</ul></li>
