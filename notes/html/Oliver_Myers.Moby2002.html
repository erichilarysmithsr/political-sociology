<h1>Oliver, Pamela and Daniel J. Myers. 2002. "The coevolution of social movements." <em>Mobilization</em> 8(1): 1-24.</h1>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Two arguments
<ol>
<li>Coevolution can provide a theoretical structure for organizing existing understandings of social movements and sharpening future research.</li>
<li>Developing formal models of movement coevolution is a crucial part of a total research program for understanding social movements.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Two fundamental observations
<ol>
<li>In social movements, actions affect other actions, e.g. diffusion, strategic interactions.</li>
<li>Mixes of actions emitted by different kinds of actors evolve (change) over time, and that action sets of actors coevolve with each other. </li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>From social movement as organism to social movement as a population of actions in a system of actions
<ul>
<li>Social movements are not coherent entities. Many different actors in each side.</li>
<li>SMs are like species - populations of collective actions with statistical distributions of properties. 
<ul>
<li>They evolve and shift in what they do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can think of SMs as a distribution of events that act across a population of actors [huh?]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategic interactions and coevolution
<ul>
<li>SMs are always shaped by actions of opponents and bystanders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Event-oriented and theoretical synthesis
<ul>
<li>Uniting RM, frames, and PPT into a coevolutionary synthesis. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Towards formal models: some initial results
<ul>
<li>Dynamics of Contention -- moving away from thinking of causes and effects and towards identifying mechanisms and processes that occur across many settings.</li>
<li>Key mechanisms - stochastic probabilities, diffusion, adaptive learning, mutual adaption, and competition.</li>
<li>Need to formalize mechanisms, and whether the formalization can produce the kinds of patterns that are empirically observed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Formal models and the realities of collective action
<ul>
<li>Simple stochastic processes - purely random processes produce event series which exhibit apparent cycles.  </li>
<li>Processes that change probabilities: Diffusion and adaptive learning - probabilities change.
<ul>
<li>adaptive learning is a process where actors change behavior depending on its outcomes.</li>
<li>diffusion is a process in which people change behavior depending on what others are doing.
<ul>
<li>Mathematically, key is that probability of action is a function of the amount of prior action.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mutual reinforcement processes - protest actors in a coevolutionary relationship in which each modifies their behavior in response to the other. </li>
<li>Competition and differential selection processes - mix of action types is affected by the differential response to them by a regime.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
