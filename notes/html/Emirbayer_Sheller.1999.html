<li><p>Reclaiming civil society and public sphere</p>

<ol>
<li>Idea of the associational civil society, autonomous from
political and economic determinisms.</li>
<li>Networks of publicity that interact with major institutions.</li>
<li>System of empircal research which addresses substantive issues
surrounding democracy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Civil society and publicity</p>

<ul>
<li>Focus of CH research has traditionally been either political
(the relatively autonomous state, administrative bureaucracy) or
economic (capitalist relations, move from feudalism to
capitalism). They have treated civil society as a residual category.</li>
<li>Also a "free spaces" approach that is a reaction against the
prior approaches. However they do not find ways to interface
with the other two spheres and they are undertheorized.</li>
<li>Civil society as existing between the state and economy, having
four organizing principles: (1) plurality; (2) publicity; (3)
privacy; and (4) legality.</li>
<li>Concept allows researchers to explore variable automony of
actors within civil society vis-a-vis the economy and the
state; also allows the elaboration of cross-national comparisons.</li>
<li>Understanding of publics as "open-ended flows of communication
that enable socially distant interlocutors to bridge social
network positions, formulate collective orientations, and
generate psychical 'working alliances' in pursuit of influence
over issues of common concern." (p. 156)</li>
<li>Three types of publicity - (1) taking into account power
differentials; (2) time-space distanciation; (3) publics that
interface with political and economic structures, as well as
reflexively consider themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Challenges for future research</p>

<ul>
<li>Social action as shaped by a plurality of relational
environments: social-structural (networks), cultural, and
social-psychological (emotions and psychic aspects) 
<ul>
<li>"Working alliances" as "constellation of social actors held
together by a common commitment to constructive engagement
and solving problems"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Micro-dynamics of publicity - agency as "engagement by actors of
different structural contexts, which... both reproduces and
transforms those structures in interactive response to the
problems posed by changing historical situations" (Emirbayer and
Mische 1998)
<ul>
<li>Agency as pragmatic, oriented towards problem-solving. Three
"tones" of agency:
<ul>
<li><em>Iteration</em> - periodical, cyclic activities that help
sustain identities, interactions, and activites over time.</li>
<li><em>Projective</em> - new forms that are oriented in response to
actors' fears, hopes, and desires for the future.</li>
<li><em>Practice evaluation</em> - akin to rational-critical publics of
Habermas, but also includes adjustment and adaptation </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Macro-dynamics of publicity - actual impact of publics
<ul>
<li>Suggestion here for empirical program is to focus on
sequences of events and turning points.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
