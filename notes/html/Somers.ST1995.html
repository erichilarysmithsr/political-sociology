<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Understanding the connections between Habermas, on one hand, and Parsons, modernization theory, and behaviorist theorists, on the other.</li>
<li>The political culture concept is used in a way that is hard political or cultural.</li>
<li>These writers use the political culture concept in an anti-political and naturalist way because the concept's embeddedness in a political and cultural structure - Anglo-American citizenship theory.</li>
<li>Need to develop a historical sociology of concept formation to uncover what is happening here.</li>
<li>Since political culture concept has occupied a place in this history, political culture concept was made to depend on its critical job of adjudicating and guarding the boundaries between public and private. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Political sociology and the political culture concept
<ul>
<li>Phase 1 - Parsons - obsession with the cultural, seeing three systems: social, cultural, and psychological.
<ul>
<li>Introduction of culture as a critical intervening variable for explaining democratic political outcomes.</li>
<li>Political sociologists taking advantage of Parson's normative scheme, esp. <a href="Almond_Verba.1963.html">Almond and Verba</a>.</li>
<li>Parsons saw a resurgence because it could be aggregated and empirically translated into a range of variables.</li>
<li>Parsons should also be praised for reintroducing normative/cultural sphere of civic culture into macrosociological explanation.</li>
<li>Many criticisms of this -- rational individualist, unitary culture of one country, abstractness of values constituting the political culture concept.</li>
<li>Punting on this concept, especially with ideas of "backward" countries.</li>
<li>Biggest criticism - causal analysis is already inscribed in the concept itself. Social system, the independent variable, is inscribed at the outset in the intervening (political culture) and dependent variables (democratic stability).</li>
<li>Concept of culture in Parsonian political culture is more social than cultural.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Phase 2: Habermas's public sphere: political culture as bourgeois rationality
