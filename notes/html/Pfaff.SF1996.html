<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>How did popular protest arise and what accounts for the seemingly
spontaneous nature of the revolution? How could an atomized
population foster enough solidarity to face the risk of state
retribution? What are the factors that impelled social action?</li>
<li>Prior models fail to take account of value expectancy. 
<ul>
<li>Do actors arrive at matters of personal value and calculate
their expectations on the basis of individual experience alone?
Can identities be considered fixed at the moment of movement
participation or are they dynamic constructs? How did actors
arrive at collective grievances, at the decision to risk their
lives and welfare?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Viewing the experience of belonging to social groups as crucial
to the construction of collective dientities, solidarities, and
grievance frames that make risky protest action possible. </li>
<li>Revolution was facilitated by collective identities and social
solidarities that arose in the private sphere of trusted friends
and associates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social movement theory and the East German Revolution
<ul>
<li>Need to move away from sheerly macrosocial models and suggest
that prevailing theories of SMs be changed to include loosely
structured and network-based collective action in authoritarian
contexts. </li>
<li>Need to understand values and expectations of social actors --
they are not determined by political structures or political
opportunities. </li>
<li>Vanguard groups had little power to spearhead
mobilizations. Furthermore, protest started in Leipzig and not
Berlin. </li>
<li>Both new social movement and resource mobilization theory cannot
address authoritarian and non-Western societies. </li>
<li>Collective identities vis-a-vis Gould (1995) may be crucial
factors. </li>
<li>Need to examine construction of collective identities and
operation of social networks in this authoritarian context. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identity, solidarity, and the revolt against Communism
<ul>
<li>How collective identities are constructed and how actors are
mobilized to revolt in a highly repressive society</li>
<li>Instead of seeing identities as constructed privately and prior
to participation ("mobilization potential") identity should be
seen as a dynamic construct drawn from collective
narratives that can be transformed into movement participation
itself.</li>
<li>Identities are situation within communities of shared beliefs,
values, and ideologies that can precede formal organization. </li>
<li>It is on this bases that loyalty and trust are reached.</li>
<li>Sense of community fostered in small groups that are large enough
to have an impact on the collective. </li>
<li>Social networks become potent mobilizers of collective action
when they manage to activate a community's identities,
grievances, and values in the context of a rapidly shifting
political structure. </li>
<li>Networks nurture collective identities and solidarity, provide
informal organization and contacts, and supply information
otherwise unavailable to individuals. </li>
<li>Reason that revolution was surprising was that there's a deep
contrast between public and private life in authoritarian
societies.</li>
<li>Drawing on "hidden transcripts" (Scott 1990) of dissent - dissent
and informal organization as socially embedded and opaque to
authorities.   </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Political opportunity and popular protest: an analysis of "Leipzig
 autumn"
<ul>
<li>Political structures and opportunity alone was important, but it
was not wholly determinative.</li>
<li>Three key social elements: expectations of solidarity; framing of
grievances based on widespread belief in social justice; and
construction of an oppositional identity by protesters through
the use of the concept of <em>das Volk</em> ("the People")</li>
<li><em>expectations of solidarity</em> - Given the pervasiveness of state
police, this meant a retreat to trusted, like-minded
friends. Grievances were better expressed in the context of
collectives. Individual nonparticipation would be suffereing
unacceptable damage to an identity in which much is
invested (Calhoun 1991).</li>
<li><em>social injustice</em> - the values that the regime stood for could
be used against it for its failure to extend political liberty
and benefits of socialism equally.</li>
<li><em>formation of a protest identity</em> - emblematic idea of the <em>Volk</em>,
connecting the idea of German nationalism with socialism and
democracy.</li>
</ul></li>
