<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Political process theory (PPT) is pretty hot stuff.</li>
<li>Criticisms: 
<ul>
<li>Overly focused on structure</li>
<li>Inability to reach agreement about the definitions of it concepts, which has hindered testing and refinement of theoretical propositions.</li>
<li>The two most influential strands of PPT - political opportunity thesis and the political process model, are tautological, trivial, inadequate, or just wrong. It is not a "model"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bias behind these problems are "structural" factors are seen and emphasized more readily than others</li>
<li>Would rather provide a more expansive set of concepts and distinctions for the analysis of social movements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The political opportunity thesis
<ul>
<li>The POS thesis claims "social movements emerge a a result of 'expanding' political opportunities" (Tarrow 1998 17-18, 81, 150)
<ul>
<li>Necessary and possibly sufficient condition is the opening up of political opportunities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This thesis is dependent on the definition of political opportunity
<ul>
<li>The broadest definition makes the thesis tautological - chance for people to get together.</li>
<li>In response, POS theorists have narrowed it to open it to falsifiability, but then the definition may be too narrow to fit any movement. </li>
<li>Could be used to define anything and everything.</li>
<li>McAdam's (1996) definition: (1) relative openness or closure of the institutionalized political system; (2) the stability or instability of that broad set of elite alignments that typically undergird a polity; (3) the presence or absence of elite allies; (4) the state's capacity and propensity for repression.</li>
<li>But this definition does not adequately address many factors</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is a political opportunity?
<ul>
<li>McAdam explicitly excludes culture from the definition and focuses on structure.</li>
<li>However, from cultural constructionist perspective, still depends on cultural interpretation.
<ul>
<li>Structural bias also restricts which movements to study. Usually focuses on groups pursuing political participation or rights.
<ul>
<li>Focuses attention on protestors' interactions with the state.</li>
<li>Ignored as movements that challenge extant cultural codes, such as new social movements, artistic movements [and right-wing movements]</li>
<li>Also biases the types of activities observed and explained in these movements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do opportunities work?
<ul>
<li>There is no clear consensus on the causal mechanisms which connect political opportunity variables to mobilization.           </li>
<li>At the most basic level they allow some sorts of action and constrain others.</li>
<li>Political opportunities operate differently at different times. They are historically and situationally contingent.</li>
<li>The political opportunity structure, as an invariant causal model, can be just plain wrong. In some situations, SM emerge as political opportunities are contracting.</li>
<li>Need to ask about strategic action - where do the available repertoires of tactics come from, how do activists choose from among them, how do they apply the ones they choose, what effects different choices have</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The political process model
<ul>
<li>this model still relies on overly structural factors. Idea of networks and formal organizations as structures. But they see them as preexisting and not as emergent.</li>
<li>change from McAdam's 1982 model, turning "indigenous organizational strength" to "mobilizing structures" or "social networks"; from "cognitive liberation" to "cultural framing"</li>
<li>"mobilizing structures" is usually defined so broadly it is tautological, while "cultural framing" is defined so narrowly that it fails to capture some very important cultural elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Framing and culture
<ul>
<li>tendency to reify culture -- to conceptualize it as a distinct (and delimited) empirical social sphere or type of social action -- instead of conceptualizing and analyzng it as an ubiquitous and constitutive dimension of all social relations, structures, networks, and practices. </li>
<li>Culture is seen to "mediate" two different variables some how.</li>
<li>Framing as defined as conscious and strategic. But culture has many forms and is not always or even usually intentional or instrumental. </li>
<li>The bias here is that frames as seen as either successful or not, with organizers and recruiters trying a set of frames until one works. So it is like a political opportunity.</li>
<li>Framing suffers from an ideational or cognitive bias - not a lot of room for the emotive or the libidinal. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some modest proposals
<ol>
<li>Abandon invariant models</li>
<li>Beware of conceptual stretching</li>
<li>Recognize that cultural and strategic processes define and create the factors usually presented as "structural"</li>
<li>Do some splitting to balance the lumping - distinguish between different kinds of political opportunities</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
