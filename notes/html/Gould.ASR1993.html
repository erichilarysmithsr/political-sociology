<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Importance of networks and interdependent decisions in protest.</li>
<li>In this article, presenting a formulation of the link between individual participation and collective efficacy predicated on different assumptions: norms of fairness that encourage individuals to match contributions of others, and the desire to avoid making contributions that will be wasted.</li>
<li>Then developing a model that relates individual decisions about participation in collective action to networks of social ties that inform actors about the behavior of others.
<ul>
<li>Depends strong on the structural position of "volunteers" - when they are centrally located, dense networks offer dimmer prospects for mobilization than sparser networks.</li>
<li>Group size has variable effects, depending on density.</li>
<li>Tendencies toward intransitivity enhance mobilization by contributing to connectedness in relatively sparse networks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theory
<ul>
<li>Individuals are not utility maximizers, because fairness norms play a central part in the production of collective goods. </li>
<li>At the same time, however, decisions to contribute are informed by expectations of individual efficacy. </li>
<li><em>Boundary conditions</em> 
<ul>
<li><em>Efficacy</em> - individuals must perceive a difference in the potential impact of their own efforts based on the efforts of others.</li>
<li>Initial contributions must represent sunk costs - individuals cannot retract contributions if responses are not forthcoming.  </li>
<li>Actors must perceive themselves as members of an identifiable collectivity. </li>
</ul></li>

<li>The Model [pausing here]</li>
