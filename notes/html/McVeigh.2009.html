<h2>Ch. 3 - Power devaluation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Need a theory to explain the emergence of right-wing movements.</li>
<li>By right-wing movement, meaning movement of those who are relatively advantaged in society with the goal of maintaining and preserving their rights and privileges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do grievances matter?
<ul>
<li>The falling out of favor of theories based on collective grievances and individual psychological responses. </li>
<li>But the logic of RM theory and political-process do not explain the emerged of movements composed of relatively privileged actors that do not face state repression and have organizational resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Should we return to classical theory?
<ul>
<li>Earliest explanations focused psychological mechanisms, the frustration that had been because of the upsetting of the existing moral order. Acting irrational, gullible, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Power-devaluation model
<ul>
<li>Grievances matter because by definition the grievances of a right-wing movement are time-variant. 
<ul>
<li>"The fact that members of the group are acting within a social movement suggests that participants sense that their capacity to maintain privileges by acting within the established institutions is being threatened" (38).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three main components - power devaluation, resulting from structural change, produces shifts in interpretive processes which, in turn, lead to activation of organizational resources and exploitation of political opportunities. (39)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Power devaluation (economic, political, and status-based)
<ul>
<li>"Devaluation in actors' [economic, political, and status-based] purchasing power within an exchange market results from a decline in the demand for what an actor offers in the exchange, and from an increase in the supply of others who offer the same thing in exchange."</li>
<li>Forms of power-devaluation as deeply intertwined. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretive processes
<ul>
<li>Power devaluation by itself does not produce right-wing mobilization. But it alters individuals' perceptions of their circumstances and allows them to develop new interpretive frames.</li>
<li>Actors also need to believe that change is possible and that the outcome desired is possible to achieve.</li>
<li>A successful frame must have diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational components.</li>
<li>One frame that people capitalize is that of cultural identity. Individuals can potentially regain status by connecting to these identities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organizational resources and political opportunities
<ul>
<li>Resources should be treated as a variable rather than a constant. Right-wing movements still need resources. </li>
<li>They also need opportunities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
