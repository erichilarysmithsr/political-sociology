<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Social networks serve as channels of political mobilization</li>
<li>But what kind of networks are the best for mobilization? Ties vary along strength, frequency, and contents. </li>
<li>How to conceptualize tie strength?</li>
<li>This article compares effectiveness of various types of social network as recruitment channels in different forms of political participation.
<ul>
<li>Focusing on strong ties and associational ties</li>
<li>also identifying theoretical mechanisms which underlie the network effects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strong vs. weak ties
<ul>
<li>Literature suggests that strong ties are better for participation because participation has social requires and costs of non-participation are higher.</li>
<li>However, supporting empirical evidence is limited. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Civic associational ties
<ul>
<li>Literature has said that locus of social networks in civic associations and SMOs.</li>
<li>But these studies actually show that participants in a movement are often members of civic associations or members of civic associations are more likely to participate in a movement.</li>
<li>Associational ties also may be activated if they turn on one's activist identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data and methods
<ul>
<li>Citizen Participation Study</li>
<li>Outcome variables - whether respondents participated in three types of political activities in response to requests personally made by recruiters.</li>
<li>Independent variables - describe the relationship between the person who made a request and the one who received it.
<ul>
<li>stranger, indirect tie, acquaintance, or close tie.</li>
<li>associational tie - civic association</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Findings
<ul>
<li>Contacting officials is higher for acquaintance and close ties; community politics as well. </li>
<li>However, there is no robust evidence for the effect of the relationship type on protest participation, for either the directness or closeness of the relationship. </li>
<li>Locus of recruitment network is not sig associated with contacted gov't officials. Neighbors are a little better at getting those involved with community politics. </li>
<li>And in protest participation, associational ties are stat. sig. and more successful in recruiting a protest participant. </li>
</ul></li>
