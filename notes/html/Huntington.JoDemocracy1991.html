<h1>Huntington, Samuel. 1991. "Democracy's Third Wave." <em>Journal of Democracy</em> 2(2).</h1>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Five majors factors have contributed to the occurrence and the timing of the third-wave transitions to democracy.
<ol>
<li>Deepening legitimacy problems of authoritarian regimes caused by the world accepting democratic norms and inability to maintain "performance legitimacy" due to economic and sometimes military failure.</li>
<li>Unprecedented global economic growth of the 1960s.</li>
<li>Shift in the doctrine and activities of the Catholic Church; transformation of the church from defenders of the status quo to opponents of authoritarianism.</li>
<li>Changes in policies of external actors, most notably EU, US, and USSR.</li>
<li>"Snowballing," or the demonstration effect of transitions earlier in the third wave in stimulating and providing models for subsequent efforts at democratization. </li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reverse third wave
<ul>
<li>Factors causing transitions away from democracy during the first and second waves: weakness of democratic values among key elite groups and the general public; severe economic setbacks; social and political polarization; determination of conservative middle-class and upper-class groups to exclude populist and leftist movements and lower-class groups from political power; breakdown of law and order resulting from terrorism or insurgency; intervention or conquest by a nondemocratic foreign power; "reverse snowballing"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Obstacles to democratization
<ul>
<li>No prior experience with democracy</li>
<li>Authoritarian rulers; but they will eventually die off.</li>
<li>Absence or weakness of real commitments to democratic values among politica leaders.</li>
<li><em>Culture</em> - suggestion that either Western culture is only suitable to democracy, or a few non-Western cultures are hostile to it: Confucianism and Islam. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
