<h2>Notes from Ermakoff's seminar, Fall 2010</h2>

<ol>
<li>Key claim
<ul>
<li>In unsettled times, explicit ideologies directly govern action.
<ul>
<li>Buy why?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ideology defined here as a symbolic system, derived from Geertz.
<ul>
<li>Geertz was the first to propose the concept of ideology as a symbolic system, regardless of its political content.</li>
<li>From the moment one is self-conscious of their worldview, s/he has an ideology</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In times of crisis, people lose their bearings. Meaning becomes problematic. Ideology, then, provides one with a roadmap; they self-consciously endorse meaning systems because they shape action in a world that lacks meaning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Criticisms
<ol>
<li>The definition and distinction between settled and unsettled times.
<ul>
<li>Intuitively, the concept of unsettled times is a conjuncture in which institutions have broken down. </li>
<li>In settled times, culture is integrated with action; in unsettled times there is a disjuncture between culture and action. Ideology shapes action.</li>
<li>However, Swidler makes a tautological definition of unsettled times - they are the times in which ideology shapes action - exactly what she is trying to show.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The functional argument that ideology provides meaning in times in which meaning is lack has no theory of motivation.
<ul>
<li>What drives people to adopt motivation?</li>
<li>It could be possible that actions occur, then people adopt an ideology post hoc to rationalize their actions that align with pre-existing beliefs.</li>
<li>Swidler makes this an argument of motivation, however.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
