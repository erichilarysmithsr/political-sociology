<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Oliver-Marwell breaking Olson's selective incentives model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A stochastic learning model of critical mass
<ul>
<li>Extending the theory of critical mass by relaxing four strong constraints in the original formulation: rational actors; decisions are isolated events; outcomes are deterministic; and pure jointness of supply</li>
<li><em>Learning and rationality</em> 
<ul>
<li>Generally cannot expect full rationality. </li>
<li>Outcomes of social interaction operate as positive and negative sanctions or social cues that guide actors toward anomie or solidarity through a process of stochastic search, based on reinforcement and attenuation of cooperative propensities. </li>
<li>This view extends theory of critical mass in three ways -
<ol>
<li>reduces cognitive demands on the actors - instead of being "forward-looking" actors, they can be "backward-looking" - they tend to repeat choices that seem to pay and avoid those that prove costly.</li>
<li>applies to behavior based on normative as well as instrumental concerns - moves can be rule-governed, and not just pragmatic. "Enthusiasm for participation reflects the experience of <em>collective</em> rather than <em>personal</em> efficacy." (812)</li>
<li>applies to situations where rational actors may be trapped by strategic "gaming"</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Serial decisions, uncertainty, and social leverage</em> 
<ul>
<li>Need to relax three further assumptions - events are discrete, processes are deterministic, and public goods are pure and collectively profitable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need to further specify the production function and the learning algorithm
