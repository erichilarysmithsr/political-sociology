<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Why shouldn't growth of communication and movement across national boundaries create new global strategies aimed at well-being and equity at the same time that it stimulates transnational finance and trade?</li>
<li>Global rules and networks constructed around interests of transnational corporations are "hegemonic" in two ways: they are dominant in their ability to provide rewards and impose sanctions, and they are ideologically dominant.</li>
<li>However ordinary people take advantage of communication and transportation networks to create a kind of "globalization from below"
<ul>
<li>But this creation does not change the dominant global rules, the way these rules are made, or the economic ideology that legitimates them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This essay explores other transnationally organized political, economic, and cultural networks that are emerging alongside the reorganization of global finance and production.</li>
<li>Globalization from below represents a challenge to constrain the power of global elites, and are therefore counter-hegemonic.</li>
<li>Three different, although interrelated kinds of transnational action: 
<ol>
<li>Transnational advocacy networks - networks created around issues like human rights, women's rights, and the destruction of the natural environment.</li>
<li>Transnational consumer/labor networks - such as those targeted sweatshop exploitation. Transnational corporations rather than local violators of global norms are the principal targets.</li>
<li>Labor movement - acts by demanding spread of "core labor standards," mostly the right to organize. However they are closely rooted in traditional political logic of interest conflict.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How can these networks affect the most marginalized citizens? If "counter-hegemonic" global networks are to have a progressive effect, it is these groups above all that must benefit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transnational advocacy networks
<ul>
<li>Immediate impact of building transnational ties is that those who are resource-poor gain new leverage. Power comes from transmitting information, invoking norms, and shifting political venues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Purchasing power as a global political tool
<ul>
<li>Globalization connections consumers in rich nations with workers in misery conditions. This connection creates possibilities for counter-hegemonic globalization.</li>
<li>Nike and the anti-sweatshop movement as a key example here.</li>
<li>One part of this is uncovering how products are produced, which takes a lot of work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New ways to unite the world's workers
<ul>
<li>Effect of globalization in increasing the power of transnational capital. They also create a demand for global governance institutions that provide the transparency and predictability that capital needs itself.</li>
<li>Labor can take advantage of these governance structures for their own advantage [basically <a href="Kay.AJS2005.html">Kay's</a> argument.]</li>
<li>WTO could possible make organized labor a priority issue. Labor standards could be basis of "unfair competition" for corporations, could be used to leverage against transnational corporations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prospects for the reconstruction global governance
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to construct new global governance structures for the operation of capital. </li>
<li>This construction is difficult given the elite ideology of the US, which is distrustful of anything that reduces the sovereignty of the US.</li>
</ul></li>
