<h1>Keck, Margaret and Kathryn Sikkink. 1998. <em>Activists beyond borders: Advocacy networks in international politics</em></h1>

<h2>Notes from reviews</h2>

<ol>
<li>Polletta in <em>CS</em>
<ul>
<li>"Keck and Sikkink argue that transnational advocacy networks have proliferated in recent decades as a result of sophisticated communication technologies, the activist legacy of the 1960s, and the global spread of a normative discourse of human rights."</li>
<li>Language matters, insofar as it resonants with larger publics</li>
<li>The networks promoting causes and the vulnerability of the target group to moral and material pressure also matter.</li>
<li>They do not connect domestic movements and advocacy networks.</li>
<li>There is no theory of the mass media in this volume.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smith in <em>APSR</em>
<ul>
<li>Networks are composed of nonstate actors, NGOs, foundations, sympathetic individuals serving in government and intergovernment agencies.</li>
<li>Individuals' participation in international political processes has important political implications. It affects their views of global problems and politics and advances their skills for participation in these processes.</li>
</ul></li>
