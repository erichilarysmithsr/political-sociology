<title>Political sociology prelim reading calendar, Fall-Winter 2012</title></p>

<h1>Political sociology prelim reading calendar, Fall-Winter 2012</h1>

<h2>Rationale for this schedule</h2>

<p>Coming off of studying for the comparative-historical prelim, there's a lot of overlap here. I'm going to try to build off of that material and therefore I am choosing to ignore a few subjects that I have looked at in-depth (revolutions, state formation, political and ethnic violence). There are pieces that I did not look at that I do want to look at more closely, more specifically in the fields of welfare state. </p>

<p>There's about 16 weeks of studying between now (Sept. 5) and the prelim (either January 8 or 9). So I'm going to parcel out readings across that stretch. I won't be able to do what I did for the comparative-historical prelim (duh) in which I was able to knock out something like four or five books a week. A possibly more realistic expectation is to schedule two four-hour sessions a week, which means getting through something like four articles, or two books, a week. </p>
