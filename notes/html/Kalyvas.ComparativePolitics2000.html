<h1>Kalyvas, Stathis. 2000. "Commitment Problems in Emerging Democracies: The Case of Religious Parties." <em>Comparative Politics</em> 32(4): 379-398.</h1>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>When incumbents in an emerging democracy face religious challengers who have the option to forgo democracy or are willing to cede their main objective to maintain legitimate democratic power. </li>
<li>When these challengers win elections, incumbents do not have to comply democratically (democracy is not the only game in town) -- they can use the legitimate means of force to maintain power. </li>
<li>However, challengers need to signal that they will not usurp democracy, the commitment problem. </li>
<li>Comparing Algeria to Belgium -- the former in which the incumbents took power with the military, and Belgium in which the incumbents conceded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explaining the outcome
<ul>
<li>We should focus on political context and the actions of political actors.</li>
<li><em>Incumbents</em> - important to pay attention to shifting coalitions within the ruling bloc. Members of civil society advocated for military intervention and the cancellation of the second round of elections in Algeria. </li>
<li><em>Challengers</em> - Islamic challengers were unable to manage their internal contradictions and division and appease the ruling bloc. The party spoke with different voices. </li>
<li>However, in Belgium the Catholics were able to put moderates in control and repudiate and purge the radicals.
<ul>
<li>Could explain the difference in unitary changes in discourse given the structures of Catholicism and Islam. The former as hierarchical, the latter as decentralized. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul>
<li>Existing institutions are important, both religious and state.</li>
<li>Effect of institutions can be surprising -- democratization as facilitated by hierarchical and autocratic religious structure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
