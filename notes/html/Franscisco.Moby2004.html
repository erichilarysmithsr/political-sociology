<h1>Franciso, Ronald A. "After the massacre: Mobilization in the wake of harsh repression." <em>Mobilization</em> 9(2).</h1>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Not much research about what happens after a massacre.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repression events
<ul>
<li>Including events that have (1) non-violent unarmed dissidents in (2) a non-democratic country who are (3) shot, killed, or injured in a discrete incident by state forces with at least three are killed and a total set of causalities over 30. Genocide is excluded.</li>
<li>Large amount of backlash taking place after most massacres.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collective-action theory and post-massacre backlash
<ul>
<li>Information transmission about a massacre
<ul>
<li>needing sufficient amount of this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Leadership
<ul>
<li>Generating adaptive tactics to overcome resistance to protest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risks of backlash
<ul>
<li>Biggest risk is identities of protesters becoming known.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mobilization
<ul>
<li>But why would any individual act against the state after a massacre</li>
<li>Using Bayesian updating to test. If there are deaths and injuries on post-massacre days 1 and 2, probably less likely to be mobilization on day three. </li>
</ul></li>
