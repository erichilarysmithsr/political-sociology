<h1>Summary notes on political culture, public sphere, civil society, social capital</h1>

<h2>Civil society, social capital, and associational life</h2>

<h3>The classics: Durkheim, Marx, and Tocqueville</h3>

<p>Durkheim can be useful in the sense of a discussion of civil society in terms of the division of labor from organic to mechanical solidarities. I think. I mostly agree with Tilly that Durkheim is useless. Marx's discussion of civil society is mostly pejorative in his early writings, equating it with the world of capitalists and trickery. Tocqueville is the most influential in the American tradition, suggesting that Americans are always forming associations for whatever reason. They are "joiners", so to speak. He thinks this is a distinctly American thing.</p>

<h3>Portes, Alejandro. 1998. "Social capital: Its Origins and Applications in Modern Sociology." <em>ARS</em> 24.</h3>

<p>Portes highlights and reviews the work on social capital. He suggests that the power of social capital comes from two sources: positive consequences of sociability, and how it relates to other sources of capital. He suggests distinguishing between the possessors of social capital, its sources, and the resources themselves. Social capital inheres in the structures of relationships. Bounded solidarity is the source of social capital in which one identifies with a particular group. The effects of social capital allow it as a source of social control, of family support, and benefits through extrafamilial networks. Negative social capital is when those same mechanisms have negative, less desirable consequences. He criticizes the concept of social capital that is associated with "civicness" as suggested by Putnam, saying that this argument is circular and social capital is both a cause and effect. He suggests, to use this concept in this fashion, need to separate the definition from its alleged effects, establish some controls for directionality, control for presence of other factors that may account for both, and identify the historical origins of community social capital in a systematic manner.</p>

<h3>Coleman, James. 1988. "Social capital in the Creation of Human Capital." <em>AJS</em> 94.</h3>

<p>Coleman is attempting to connect RCT and normative theories of social action together. He suggests that social capital could be a conceptual tool for this. He suggests that social capital is a particular kind of resource available to an actor which consists of some aspect of social structure and the facilitation of certain actions of actors within the structures. He suggests three forms: obligations, expectations, and trustworthiness of structures; information channels; and norms and effective sanctions. Structure facilitates social capital insofar as it provides closure of networks, and intergenerational closure. Social capital creates human capital inside and outside of the family.</p>

<h3>Marsden, Peter V. 1987. "Core Discussion Networks of Americans." <em>ASR</em> 52(1).</h3>

<p>In this initial study, Marsden describes the features of core social networks of Americans, measured on a number of factors: size, kin/nonkin, density, and heterogeneity. He uses GSS data to get network data, suggesting that more and stronger ties are better for social support and well-being. This is referential because it sets up an argument for how networks have changed over time.</p>

<h3>McPherson et al. 2006. "Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades." <em>ASR</em> 71(3).</h3>

<p>McPherson et al. suggest that over the last two decades, dating from Marsden's initial study, core discussion networks have shrunk over time. He uses the same survey as Marsden, but the questions have changed somewhat. He suggests that this provides support to the Putnam <em>Bowling Alone</em> thesis. In a reply, Fischer thinks that the effect is an artifact of some missing data. McPherson et al respond that Fischer is full of it, they used a Poisson distribution to account for this. There are more details on what happened here but I doubt the prelim committee is terribly interested.</p>

<h3>Putnam, Robert. 1993. <em>Making Democracy Work</em>.</h3>

<p>(notes cribbed from CH)</p>

<p>Putnam is attempting explain the differential in the effectiveness of democratic institutions in Italy. He has the ability to conduct somewhat of a natural experiment after, in 1970, the central Italian government establishes some administrative districts that handle and administer local social services. He associates this with the idea of "civic community" which is measured through civic engagement and associational life. He finds that there is a strong correlation between institutional performance and civicness. Civic culture has a direct correlation with democracy for Putnam. Putnam explains civic culture by tying it back to the cultural legacies of North and South Italy. The North had a much more communal and associational character than the South, which was ruled by Norman absolutism and takes the character of a protection racket in which people view each other with suspicion. Putnam pays close attention to micro foundations and theorizes that in the North, people are bound by strong trust networks in which there is ample exchange of social capital.</p>

<p>Methodologically, Putnam is a pluralist, drawing on a lot of historical information, as well as quantitative measures. He also measures and compares effects on the subnational regional level, which allows him to take a national policy as given while measuring regional variation.</p>

<p>The criticisms of Putnam's work are that the measures of institutional efficacy and civicness are perhaps too strongly correlated. They may be measuring the same thing. There's also a strong determinism implied here, that a culture cultivated 500 years in the past is strong enough to affect institutional designs in the present.</p>

<h3>Putnam, Robert. 1995. "Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital." <em>Journal of Democracy</em>. (and 2000. <em>Bowling Alone</em>)</h3>

<p>Putnam argues that membership to civil society organizations in the US has decreased. He also suggests that family cohesion has decreased and connections between neighbors have as well. He suggests that this is due to the movement of women into the labor force, other demographic shifts, and technological transformation of leisure. Putnam has been criticized for his use of social capital, which seems to encompass many different aspects of civic engagement. He also doesn't seem to provide a strong case for the reason behind this decline.</p>

<h3>Paxton, Pamela. 2002. "Social capital and democracy: an interdependent relationship." <em>ASR</em> 67.</h3>

<p>Paxton argues that the link between social capital and democracy is not clear, even though this is what Putnam contends. She contends that Putnam is measuring government efficiency and not democracy. She wants to measure the possible effect of democracy on social capital, and disentangle the different effects of different associations on democracy. She designs a study which looks at associations and also their content. Responding to Portes's critique, the study divorces social capital from its potential consequences. She suggests that social capital can affect democracy by creating it in a country that is not democracy, and or maintaining it and improving it in an already existing democracy. It is also possible to that social capital will have negative effects. Using two datasets, she finds that democracy significantly affects two components of social capital -- association and trust -- while social capital does not affect democracy. In the second dataset, she finds that democracy affects associations in the first period, then the reverse happens. Lastly, she finds that isolated associations, measured in trade unions, sports clubs, and religious organizations, do not have an influence on democracy, while connected associations (defined as everything else) do.</p>

<h3>Berman, Sheri. 1997. "Civil society and the collapse of the Weimar Republic." <em>World Politics</em> 49.</h3>

<p>Berman questions the thesis of whether civil society is good for democracy. Mass society theorists (Kornhauser, Arendt) argue that if civil society had been stronger, then the Weimar would not have fallen. She argues, however, that both pre-Weimar and Weimar Germany did have very strong associational life, that associational life had been directly tied to political and economic strain. Nazis took advantage of strong associations to recruit cadres of activists who had the skills necessary to spread the party's message and increase recruitment. This allow Nazis to infiltrate and master a significant sector of bourgeois society. Berman argues that when there are strong political institutions, associations can buttress democracy. But if political structures and institutions are weak, then civil society can become an alternative for politics, which can be a breeding ground for right-wing politics. Islamic associations can be seen as doing this in the Middle East. She suggests that civil society is in general, a politically neutral multiplier -- not inherently good or bad for democracy.</p>

<h3>Riley, Dylan. 2005. "Civil Associations and Authoritarian Regimes in Interwar Europe: Italy and Spain in Comparative Perspective." <em>ASR</em> 70.</h3>

<p>Riley turns his attention to the connection between civil society and authoritarianism, rather than civil society and democracy. He compares interwar regimes in Spain and Italy and the types of authoritarian regimes they established -- in Italy a hegemonic regime, and in Spain a economic-corporate dictatorship. He suggests, following Gramsci, that associations produce technologies of political rule that can potentially extend the reach of the state. They are not necessarily opposed to authoritarian parties, and have the potential to be reabsorbed by the state. Doing a comparative-historical analysis, he finds associationism as strongly correlated with fascist party development in Italy, although unevenly distributed. Two mechanisms explain this -- fascists could expand by forming federations with allied organizations and penetrating enemy ones, and that fascists used organizational techniques developed by associations. He finds little indication of this in Spain. Lastly, Riley suggests that this radicalism doesn't have to be restricted to right-wing mobilization.</p>

<h3>Sherry Turkle. 2011. <em>Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other</em>.</h3>

<p>Turkle's basic thesis is that technology is one of the culprits that is resulting in declining social capital. Individuals are more into technological connection than in-person connections, which takes away from many aspects of humanizing -- from the political, the social, etc etc.</p>

<h3>Rainie, Lee and Barry Wellman. 2012. <em>Networked: The New Social Operating System</em>.</h3>

<p>Raine and Wellman suggest that, <em>pace</em> Turkle, technology does not have a negative effect on social capital and interpersonal contact. In fact, those individuals who are heavy users of social media and the Internet for communication are in general more active communicators and have strong ties offline as well. It is not a zero-sum game of communication.</p>

<h2>Political culture</h2>

<h3>Berezin, Mabel. 1997. "Politics and Culture: A Less Fissured Terrain." <em>ARS</em> 23.</h3>

<p>Berezin suggests four subareas for politics and culture: political culture (which encompasses the study of how cultural attitudes determine political practices); institutions (the relation of the state and culture, culture and state formation); political communication and meaning (cultural practices about how individuals receive information about politics); and collective action (the cultural turn in the study of contentious politics).</p>

<h3>Almond, Gabriel and Sidney Verba. 1963. <em>Civic Culture</em>.</h3>

<p>Almond and Verba are some of the first to connect culture with political outcomes, namely, in the study of democracy. They define culture as the "psychological orientation  toward social objects... the political system as internalized in the cognitions, feelings, and evaluations of its population" and suggest that political culture is the distribution of these patterns of orientations towards political objects. The suggest three dimensions of attitudes towards political objects -- cognition (knowledge and belief about the political system); affective (feelings about the political system); and evaluation (judgments and opinions about political objects). Then they define four political objects -- the system in general, its inputs, its outputs, and then the self in the political system. Then form three pure types of political culture -- parochial, subject, and participant, which are pasted on particular attitudes towards particular objects. There are mixes between the different systems. The most important culture is the civic culture, which is the participant culture oriented positively to input structures and processes, but they combine with subject and parochial cultures to "temper" the participant one. Nonpolitical attitudes such as trust in others matter. They take this to be the missing link which mediates microlevel factors and macropolitics.  They look at the US, Britain, Italy, Mexico, and Germany as contrasting cases.</p>

<h3>Inglehart, Ronald. 1988. "The renaissance of political culture." <em>APSR</em> 82(4).</h3>

<p>Inglehart does a mostly exploratory analysis of how culture may mediate other aspects of political outcomes. He looks at the relationship of overall life satisfaction and economic prosperity, suggesting cultural norms mediate this relationship. He also suggests that interpersonal trust mediates the viability of democracy. Interpersonal trust correlates highly with economic develop but we are not sure which way the causality goes. Countries with stable democracies have higher life satisfaction and economic development. Finally, he suggests a correlation between postmaterial values and economic growth. Postmaterial values, such as Protestantism and secular Catholicism, spur countries to grow quickly at first, but then they do not as postmaterial values settle in.</p>

<h3>Althusser, Louis. 1970. "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses."</h3>

<p>Althusser describes in this essay the functions, processes, and mechanisms of ideology. The functions are subjugation by the ruling class and the forces of production. The process through which ideology acts is part and parcel of the state, the ideological state apparatuses (ISAs). The mechanism through which ideology acts is "interpellation" which is the act of constituting the individual through a constant act of transforming individuals into subjects. Subject here is a double entendre, meant to suggest both a self-conscious individual, but also an individual subject to domination. In many senses, Althusser could be called a class reductionist. Ideology is transhistorical and is only constituted of the "residue" of real life. </p>

<h3>Therborn, Goran. 1999. <em>The Ideology of Power and the Power of Ideology</em></h3>

<p>Therborn mostly ignores the functionalist attributes to Althusser and instead is focused on the mechanisms of ideology. He divides the act of interpellation into two separate mechanisms -- subjection and qualification. The former is the process of being subjected to certain material forms and developing subjectivity, while qualification is the process of taking up and performing certain roles in light of that subjectivity. They do not occur at the same time, and they can be in conflict with each other. The subject in Therborn is also more active than Althusser's subject, precisely because there is a process of qualification which can run against the grain of prior subjection. </p>

<h3>Swidler, Ann. 1986. "Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies." <em>ASR</em> 51.</h3>

<p>Swidler's main claim in this piece is that culture acts as a toolkit, and that it acts differently in settled and unsettled times. In settled times, culture provides resources through which individuals can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies govern action. </p>

<h3>Laitin, David. 1986. <em>Hegemony and Culture: Politics and Change among the Yoruba</em>.</h3>

<p>Laitin attempts to explain why religion do not become politicized in Yorubaland. He finds that the main cleavage was not Muslim-Christian cleavages, but cleavages associated with the ancestral city. He attempts to go beyond the systemic/cultural (Geertz) and rational choice explanations, and instead locates the reason in the hegemony that had been established with colonial rule. Hegemony sanctions the attempt for elite groups to dominate and legitimizes that domination. When hegemonic ideology is backed by state institutions, it becomes common sensical. Ideologicalizing and politicization opens up the space for counter hegemonies.</p>

<h3>Moaddel, Mahmoud. 1992. "Ideology as episodic discourse: the case of the Iranian revolution." ASR 57.</h3>

<p>Moaddel attempts to show how ideology guided action in the Iranian revolution. Ideology here served as a "episodic discourse" which guided a particular form of action. In this case, ideology more closely matches Swidler's description of it. Ideology is best described as "as a discourse consisting of a set of general principles, concepts, symbols, and rituals used by actors to address problems in a particular historical episode." Ideology is closely tied to practice. </p>

<h2>Public sphere</h2>

<h3>Habermas, Jurgen. 1989. "The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article."</h3>

<p>This is a summary of the Habermas book. The idea of the public sphere is that realm of social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed. Hypothetically access is guaranteed to all individuals, the inequalities are bracketed in favor of an "ideal speech situation" in which everyone is treated as equal. The state is a the guarantor of the public sphere but they do participate in it. "The bourgeois public sphere" could be understood as the sphere of private individuals assembled into a public body, which almost immediately laid claim to officially regulated "intellectual newspapers" for use against the public authority itself. In the era of the social welfare state mass democracy the public sphere cannot be realized because those issues that had been private have started to enter the public. The public sphere has also been subjected to special interests who only attempt to gain "publicity." A possible counter exists with a public body of organized private individuals who make proceedings of organizations dealing with the state public.</p>

<h3>Fraser, Nancy. 1990. "Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy." <em>Social Text</em> 25/26.</h3>

<p>Fraser critiques Habermas's idea of the public sphere, claiming that while it realizes advances in critical theory, it has some major issues. She suggests that the idea of the bourgeois public sphere was predicated on important exclusions -- of women, of the working class, of people of color. It was constructed on a "rational" masculinist basis. The public sphere also had been limited to bourgeois men who came to see themselves as a "universal" class, a few that had enjoined feminine domesticity and strong separation of public from private. These views eventually came to become hegemonic. </p>

<p>Fraser questions four assumptions of the public sphere: the assumption that it is possible for interlocutors in a public sphere to bracket status differentials and to deliberate "as if" they were social equals, which can serve as a mask for domination; the assumption that the proliferation of multiple competing publics is worse for democracy -- multiple publics could be better for democracy, given that these publics could compete and allow counterpublics to invent and circulate subaltern counterdiscourses; the assumption of what the discourse in the public sphere should be and what the common good is -- people will disagree on the common good, and the distinction between public and private aren't clear, can be used to delegitimize some interests, views, and topics; and finally, the assumption that there needs to be clear distinction between civil society and the state -- the "strong" public sphere that incorporates decision-making could be better for self-management and political accountability.</p>

<h3>Calhoun, Craig. 1993. "Civil society and the public sphere." <em>Public Culture</em> 5.</h3>

<p>Calhoun attempts to specify the connection between civil society and the public sphere. The two are distinct -- the public sphere is located within civil society. Habermas locates the idea of difference outside of the public sphere, that individuals have identities prior to coming to the public sphere. But that is not good because individuals tend to form identities are part of public activity -- example of mobilization and new social movements. He also suggests that we need to question the particular institutions in operation in civil society -- what is the relation of those institutions to the state?</p>

<h3>Somers, Margaret. 1993. "Citizenship and the Place of the Public Sphere: Law, Community, and Political Culture in the Transition to Democracy." <em>ASR</em> 58(5).</h3>

<p>Theories of citizenship based on T.H. Marshall's definition have three assumptions: citizenship must be defined as a status; capitalist development and citizenship formation must occur together; and theories of citizenship must be based on the relationship between the state and capitalism. Instead, Somers argues that w should think of citizenship as "instituted process"; the development of citizenship rights depended on the nexus of England's national legal infrastructure and the varying community capacities for participatory association; and we must look at the relationship between public spheres, associational life, and patterns of political culture to further understand citizenship.</p>

<h3>Mustafa Emirbayer and Mimi Sheller. 1999. "Publics in history" Theory and Society 28(1) 145-197.</h3>

<p>(taken from CH notes)</p>

<p>In this article, Emirbayer and Sheller are attempting to rearticulate the notion of civil society and public sphere. They take a more Tocquevillian approach to it, but they claim that civil society and public sphere are autonomous from political and economic determinisms. They sit "between" the two and interface with them at different points. Their notion of civil society and the public sphere here takes a very pragmatic character, in which actors in civil society generate working alliances which are oriented towards solving problems of common concern. They clarify micro-dynamics of publicity, in which agency takes various "tones" (Emirbayer and Mische 1998) as well as a more macro-dynamics of publicity that involves sequences and turning points.</p>

<h3>Ferree et al. 2002. "Four models of the public sphere in modern democracies." TS 31.</h3>

<p>Ferree and her collaborators develop a way to characterize four different models of public spheres in modern democracies. They characterize them by four dimensions -- who should be participating and on what occasions; what sort of process the discourse goes through; how the ideas should be presented; and what the desirable outcome should be of discourse and decision-making. The first model is that of representative liberalism -- elites dominant, experts are valued in given their opinions, ideas are presented in a free marketplace that has the most transparency; conversations are civil and detached, free of emotion; and closure is the desired outcome. The participatory liberalism, however, strives for maximum popular inclusion. Individuals are empowered and ideas are presented in a range of styles, from civil to emotive. They avoid imposed closure. The discursive tradition follows in the steps of Habermas, in which popular inclusion is valued and conversation is deliberative. Ideas are presented with ideas of dialogue, mutual respect, and civility, and they strive for premature, non-consensus-based closure. Finally, the constructionist perspective, following Foucault, strives for popular inclusion but also recognizes the fact that power is constituted everywhere -- process attempts empowerment and recognizes differences and silences. Ideas are presented in a range of ways, but also include the importance of story and narratives. The desired outcome avoids exclusionary closure and attempts to widen the political community.</p>
