<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Despite longtime theoretical interest in the relationship between social capital and democracy, little quantitative empirical evidence exists to support the idea that associations affect democracy.</li>
<li>Criticism of Putnam - he measures government efficiency, not democracy, as dependent variable.</li>
<li>Most empirical work does not incorporate the likely reciprocal effect of democracy on associations.</li>
<li>Different associations do not need to have equivalent effects on democracy. Do different types of associations differ in their effects on democracy?</li>
<li>Data from quant, cross-national panel study.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Definition of social capital
<ul>
<li>Social capital is the notion that social relations can facilitate the production of economic or noneconomic goods. </li>
<li>Definition of social capital on two dimensions
<ol>
<li>Objective associations among individuals</li>
<li>Associations of a particular type -- reciprocal, trusting, and involving positive emotion.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We also need to think about the content of associations, and this means assessing trust.</li>
<li>Social capital can be measured at multiple levels, divorcing social capital from its potential consequences (Portes's critique)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The theoretical link between social capital and democracy
<ul>
<li>Social capital can affect democracy in two ways:
<ol>
<li>Can create democracy in a country that is not democratic.</li>
<li>Can maintain or improve an already existing democracy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Transitions to democracy
<ul>
<li>In transitions, democracy can provide space for creation and dissemination of discourse critical of the present government; and it can provide a way for active opposition to the regime to grow.</li>
<li>Social capital as a space for discourse - SC can help create and disseminate anti-gov discourse.
<ul>
<li>Informal ties can also be important in spreading information about grievances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social capital and collective action
<ul>
<li>In the last stage of resistance to an oppressive regime, high levels of social capital can provide resources for org of opposition movements and large-scale collective action.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The maintenance of democracy
<ul>
<li>SC can help maintain democracy by affecting both the quantity and quality of political participation by citizens.</li>
<li>Can spur increased communication and flow of information, exposing individuals to new political ideas and debates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The possibility of negative effects
<ul>
<li>SC could be good at a group level, but detrimental at a higher community level.</li>
<li>Putnam distinguishes between "bridging" and "bonding" associations. Cross-cutting (bridging) associations are connected to other associations and to the larger community. Thus bridging associations should be more beneficial to democracy than associations that remain isolated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The possibility of a reciprocal effect
<ul>
<li>It is possible that causal direction runs from democracy to social capital. More associations would be expected to exist when governments allow them to exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data and measurement
<ul>
<li>Measuring social capital 
<ul>
<li>World Values Survey - measures of associations and trust. </li>
<li>Union of International Associations - number of International NGOs (INGOs)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Democracy - Bollen's measure of liberal democracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Models of social capital and democracy
<ul>
<li>WVS models
<ul>
<li>Democracy significantly affects the two components of social capital -- associations and trust -- while the reverse effect is not found.</li>
<li>Industrialization as negatively correlating with trust</li>
</ul></li>
<li>INGOs
<ul>
<li>This data reveals significant effects for both democracy and social capital. Democracy as affecting INGOs in the first period, then INGOs affecting democracy in later time periods.</li>
<li>Being a former British colony is first good for democracy, and then dramatically terrible for it. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do different types of associations have different effects on democracy?
<ul>
<li>Isolated associations - trade unions, sports clubs, and religious orgs; others as connected.</li>
<li>Connected associations have strong positive influence on democracy, while isolated associations have strong negative association on democracy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
