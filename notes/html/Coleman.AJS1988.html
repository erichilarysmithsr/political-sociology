</ul></li>
<li>Criticisms and revisions
<ul>
<li>Sociology's attempts to create an "engine of action" for the individual has not succeeded.</li>
<li>At the same time, economic actor does not accord with empirical reality.
<ul>
<li>Some attempts by neo-institutionalists to find a solution to this. Granovetter and embeddedness.</li>
<li>Using the concept of social capital to amend the RCT model.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social capital
<ul>
<li>Social capital as a particular kind of resource available to an actor.</li>
<li>Social capital as a variety of entities that are characterized by two elements: they consist of some aspect of social structures, and they facilitate certain actions of actors within the structure.</li>
<li>It is not fungible but may be specific to certain activities. </li>
<li>It is not lodged in the actors or physical implements of production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Human capital and social capital
<ul>
<li>Human capital is created by changes in persons that bring about skills and capabilities that make them able to act in new ways. </li>
<li>Social capital comes about through changes in the relations among persons that facilitate action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Forms of social capital
<ul>
<li><em>Obligations, expectations, and trustworthiness of structures</em> - exchanges between individuals, people have obligations and expectations for exchange which are not formalized.
<ul>
<li>this form of social capital depends on trustworthiness of the social environment, and the extent of the obligations held.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Information channels</em> - Potential for information that inheres in social relations. Using two-step flow of information to get latest.</li>
<li><em>Norms and effective sanctions</em> - norms can constitute a powerful form of social capital. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social structure that facilitates social capital
<ul>
<li><em>Closure of social networks</em> - necessary but not sufficient condition for the emergence of effective norms is action that imposes external effects on others. Closure promotes collective sanction.
<ul>
<li>Intergenerational closure as a form of closure between parents and children. Parents agree on norms for their children.</li>
<li>Allows for proliferation of obligations and expectations, trustworthiness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Appropriable social organization</em> - once an organization comes into being, can help generate social capital.
<ul>
<li>Importance of the multiplex relation in the generation of social capital.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social capital in the creation of human capital
<ul>
<li><em>Social capital in the family</em> - can divide family background in financial, human, and social capital. 
<ul>
<li>Complement of parents' human capital with social capital embedded in family relations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Social capital outside the family</em> - social capital found in the community consisting of the social relationships that exist among parents, and the parents' relations with the institutions of the community.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Public goods aspects of social capital
<ul>
<li>social capital benefits all of those who are part of the structure.</li>
<li>the public goods quality of most social capital means that it is in a fundamentally different position with respect to purposive action than are other forms of capital. </li>
</ul></li>
