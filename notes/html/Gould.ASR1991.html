<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Previous researchers have used purely scalar variables to measure
networks, simple counts of social ties. </li>
<li>Network structure and network multiplexity have not received
sufficient attention. </li>
<li>Goal is to demonstrate the effect of social relations on
mobilization of collective action. Correspondence between
organizational and informal networks. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Network factors in mobilization
<ul>
<li>Snow et al. 1980 and McAdam 1986 as measuring networks as
individual-level variables. 
<ul>
<li>Masks the complexity of networks and doesn't allow us to focus
on network influence. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Move to focus on network centrality. 
<ul>
<li>However, they only focus on a single network and neglect
newwork multiplexity. </li>
<li>Needs a focus on formal and informal networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Paris Commune is a good case study for three reasons.
<ul>
<li>Mobilization was effected through a highly visible formal
organization, the Paris National Guard. </li>
<li>National Guard units were roanized along neighborhood lines.</li>
<li>Connection between organizational structure and social
structure of neighborhoods permit examination into how much
these networks interacted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social networks and social movement mobilization
<ul>
<li>Mobilization doesn't just depend on social ties, it creates
them. Previous studies assume that pre-existing ties have no
further influence.</li>
<li>Paris Commune data seem to suggest that this view is
incorrect. The ties gained from neighborhood association linked
informal networks to formal networks of the National Guard. </li>
<li>Insurgents fought primarily in their own
neighborhoods. Neighborhood was the primary source of commitment
to insurgent effort. Arrest rates were higher in neighborhoods
during <em>semaine sanguine</em> </li>
<li>Solidarity and structure - neighborhood and organizational ties
act <em>jointly</em> to maintain solidarity.</li>
<li>There were insurgents who maintained organizational links across
neighborhoods and neighborhoods links across organizations. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data and methods
<ul>
<li>Testing claim on network interdependent: network autocorrelation
regression: y = pWy + XB + e, where W is amtrix of weights
representing network linsk among 20 <em>arrondissements</em> of Paris, p
as coefficient representing the degree of interdependence among
the observations, y is a vector of outcomes. 
<ul>
<li>A distict's resistence level is a function of a set of
exogenous variables and the resistance levels of all the other
districts, weighted by strength of its links with them.</li>
<li>p should be positive values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data is from archival and published sources. Average battalion
size for each <em>arrondissement</em>, number of deaths per 1,000
inhabitants for each <em>arrondissement</em>. Exogenous variables are #
of poor people, % of skilled salaried works, % as unskilled
workers, % of white-collar employees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results
<ul>
<li>Autocorrelation term is positive and significant for network
models for battalion size in early May and late May.</li>
<li>Shows that insurgents in different neighborhoods influenced each
other's degree of commitment to the insurrection through the
network of links created by overlapping enlistments. </li>
<li>This was also only unidirectional -- not reciprocal. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discussion
<ul>
<li>Necessary to appreciate structure by taking multiplexity into
account. </li>
<li>Mobilization itself creates new social ties, even as it relies on
pre-existing ties.</li>
<li>It should be possible to characterize any mobilization in terms
of mapping of formal organizational ties onoto an indigenous
network of informal ties. </li>
</ul></li>
