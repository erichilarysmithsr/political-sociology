<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>Power of social capital comes from two sources
<ul>
<li>Positive consequences of sociability.</li>
<li>Places positive consequences in the framework of a broader discussion of capital and calls attention to how such non-monetary forms can be important sources of power and influence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Definitions
<ul>
<li>Bourdieu - "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition"</li>
<li>Coleman - "a variety of entities with two elements in common: They all consist of some aspect of social structures, and they facilitate certain action of actors -- whether persons or corporate actors -- within the structure"
<ul>
<li>Vague concept, but a systematic treatment of the concept must distinguish among (a) the possessors of social capital (those making claims); (b) the sources of social capital: and (c) the resources themselves.</li>
<li>Introducing "closure" - existence of sufficient ties between a certain number of people to guarantee the observation of norms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Burt - seeing the relative absence of ties, "structural holes" that facilitates individual mobility</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sources of social capital
<ul>
<li>Social capital inheres in the structure of relationships. To possess social capital, a person must be related to others, and it is those others, not himself, who are the actual source of his/her advantage.</li>
<li>Bounded solidarity as the source of social capital in which one identifies with a particular group.</li>
<li>Another source of social capital in the theory of social integration and sanctioning capacity of group rituals.
<ul>
<li>Donors returns may not come directly from recipient but from collectivity as a whole.</li>
<li>Collectivity itself acts as guarantor that whatever debts are incurred willb e repaid.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Effects of social capital 
<ul>
<li>Using it as a predictor of many things. Three basic functions:
<ul>
<li>Source of social control</li>
<li>Source of family support</li>
<li>Source of benefits through extrafamilial networks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Negative social capital
<ul>
<li>Same mechanisms of social capital can have negative, less desirable consequences - exclusion of outsiders, excess claims on group members, restrictions on individual freedoms, and downward leveling norms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social capital as a feature of communities and nations
<ul>
<li>The equation of social capital with "civicness" that is a feature of communities such as towns, cities, and countries. </li>
<li>Robert Putnam is a strong advocate of this approach -- "features of social organizations, such as networks, norms, and trust, that facilitate action and cooperation for mutual benefit.... Working together is easier in a community blessed with a substantial stock of social capital"</li>
<li>Critique: The argument is circular: "As a property of communities and nations rather than individuals, social capital is simultaneously a cause and an effect." (19) 
<ul>
<li>Tautology stems from analytical decisions: starting with the effect and working retroactively to find out what distinguishes them; trying to explain all of the observed differences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To avoid this mistake: separate the definition of the concept from its alleged effects; establishing some controls for directionality so the presence of social capital is demonstrably prior to the outcomes it is expected to produce; controlling for the presence of other factors that can account for both social capital and its alleged effects; identifying the historical origins of community social capital in a systematic manner.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
