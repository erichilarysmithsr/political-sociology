<title>Political sociology prelim reading calendar, Fall-Winter 2012</title>

# Political sociology prelim reading calendar, Fall-Winter 2012

## Rationale for this schedule

Coming off of studying for the comparative-historical prelim, there's a lot of overlap here. I'm going to try to build off of that material and therefore I am choosing to ignore a few subjects that I have looked at in-depth (revolutions, state formation, political and ethnic violence). There are pieces that I did not look at that I do want to look at more closely, more specifically in the fields of welfare state. 

There's about 16 weeks of studying between now (Sept. 5) and the prelim (either January 8 or 9). So I'm going to parcel out readings across that stretch. I won't be able to do what I did for the comparative-historical prelim (duh) in which I was able to knock out something like four or five books a week. A possibly more realistic expectation is to schedule two four-hour sessions a week, which means getting through something like four articles, or two books, a week. 

**Edit (2012-11-01)** - I haven't been sticking with this schedule at
  all. So I'm just going to group relevant stuff that I should be able
  to read before the prelim, in any time that is dedicated to it.
