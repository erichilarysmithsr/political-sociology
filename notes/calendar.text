<title>Political sociology prelim reading calendar, Fall-Winter 2012</title>

# Political sociology prelim reading calendar, Fall-Winter 2012

## Rationale for this schedule

Coming off of studying for the comparative-historical prelim, there's a lot of overlap here. I'm going to try to build off of that material and therefore I am choosing to ignore a few subjects that I have looked at in-depth (revolutions, state formation, political and ethnic violence). There are pieces that I did not look at that I do want to look at more closely, more specifically in the fields of welfare state. 

There's about 16 weeks of studying between now (Sept. 5) and the prelim (either January 8 or 9). So I'm going to parcel out readings across that stretch. I won't be able to do what I did for the comparative-historical prelim (duh) in which I was able to knock out something like four or five books a week. A possibly more realistic expectation is to schedule two four-hour sessions a week, which means getting through something like four articles, or two books, a week. 

**Edit (2012-11-01)** - I haven't been sticking with this schedule at
  all. So I'm just going to group relevant stuff that I should be able
  to read before the prelim, in any time that is dedicated to it.

## Other stuff

1. Fascism
   - Mann, Michael. 2004. *Fascists*.
2. Iron law of oligarchy -- Robert Michels
   - Robert Michels's (1911/1962) well-known “iron law of oligarchy”
     provides one explanation for the drift from flat, participatory
     structures toward a centralized system of control and a gradual
     shift away from original goals. Michels was Weber’s pupil and
     shared his views on bureaucracy. Michels held that because
     organizational growth leads to complexity and problems of
     internal coordination, management adopts bureaucratic mechanisms
     to bring order and predictability. As organizations grow, they
     not only gain internal complexity, they also develop more
     extensive and complex relationships with other institutions. When
     external legitimacy is enhanced, leaders become more oriented
     toward their institutional environment and less oriented toward
     their organization’s initial goals (from Lowrey 2012)
