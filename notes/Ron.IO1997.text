# Ron, James. 1997. "Varying methods of state violence." *International Organization* 51(2).

1. Puzzle: changes in Israel's treatment of Palestinian detainees -- why?
2. Theory: world polity and neo-institutionalism. Israel needs to present itself in a such a way that it comports with how the world views them. They must maintain legitimacy.
3. Major claim: Palestinian public relations skill provided international organizations, namely International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and B'Tselem (Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories) with a push that moved their cause onto the world agenda. Palestinian groups triggered world polity scrutiny.
