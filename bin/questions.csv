fall2012,morning,"Scholars (e.g., Tocqueville, Lipset, Bollen and Jackman, Treisman) have often observed a strong association between Protestantism and democracy, not only in Western Europe and European- settler colonies, but also in Asian and African countries that were not Protestant European-settler colonies. Drawing on major theories of the development of or conditions for democracy, write an essay that develops one or more arguments to explain the association. Is the association causal? If yes, what is the mechanism? If not, what is the non-causal explanation for the association? "
fall2012,morning,Scholars of welfare state have suggested that America is exceptional in that its welfare programs developed late and also their coverage is relatively inadequate. Is American welfare state really exceptional? Discuss scholarly works on historical development of American welfare regime and offer your evaluations. 
fall2012,morning,"Over the last fifteen years, increasing attention has been paid to an ""eventful approach"" to political phenomena. Brubaker (2001) for instance has suggested that such an approach should be applied to nationalism. Referring to the relevant authors, outline what in your view is the gist of an ""eventful approach"" to political sociology and then discuss what could be the point of such an approach when we study nationalism and nationalist movements."
fall2012,morning,"In his book on revolutions and revolutionary movements, Goodwin argues that “the success or failure of revolutionary movements depends ...upon the nature of specific states that revolutionaries have sought to overthrow” (No Other Way Out, p. 24). Drawing on the literature on revolutions past and contemporary, discuss the empirical and analytical soundness of this statement."
fall2012,morning,"Civil society is one of the central concepts in political sociology. Choose two different analytic approaches to civil society and examine their contributions and drawbacks. In your essay, a) briefly describe each approach, summarizing what civil society means in each approach and what kinds of relationships, groups, institutions it includes or highlight; b) discuss what theoretical and empirical weaknesses in earlier research are addressed by each approach; 3) compare and contrast the two approaches and offer your assessment on which approach has the most promise for advancing empirical research."
fall2012,morning,"Are states agents, actors or arenas? Write an essay comparing and contrasting the answer to this question for three or more general theoretical conceptions of the relation between state and society."
fall2012,afternoon,"Two decades ago, one could reasonably claim that McAdam’s political process model of political mobilization had become a referential model for any full-fledged analysis of collective mobilization. Do you view this characterization of the field as appropriate nowadays? Write an essay that (1) sketches the political process model and then (2) either defends or refutes the claim that this model is still referential with references to recent work on collective mobilization."
fall2012,afternoon,"In recent Presidential elections in the United States (including the current one), there has been much discussion on how white, working class voters have defected from the Democratic Party and tend to vote for Republican candidates, whereas more affluent and educated voters in liberal states vote for Democratic candidates. What do political sociologists know about class and voting behaviors in the U.S.? Has there been “de-alignment” between social class and how people vote in national elections? What are the theoretical or historical explanations of class voting and “de- alignment” proposed by scholars? What do recent empirical studies suggest about class voting in the U.S.?"
fall2012,afternoon,"The US has seen two waves of popular protest in the past three years, first the Tea Party protests of 2009-10 and then the wave of protests beginning with the Wisconsin uprising and supportive labor protests elsewhere and followed by (flowing into?) the Occupy protests. Both protest waves were linked somehow to partisan electoral politics, but participants and analysts disputed the nature of these links. How do these protest waves fit into the broader literature on the relation between social movements and institutional and electoral politics? In writing your essay, provide a summary of prior theory and research about the issue generally, and then discuss the extent to which these two protest waves fit into or are at variance with prior research."
fall2012,afternoon,"""Identity politics” seems to be a major feature of political life in the US, Europe, and elsewhere. Write an essay in which you: (1) discuss how the idea of a political or collective identity has been defined by political sociologists and (2) discuss theoretical and empirical work on the significance of political or collective identity in electoral politics and/or social movements and protest. (3) Consider whether identity politics is best understand as a distinct kind of politics to be contrasted with other kinds of politics or best understood as a theoretical process that occurs in all politics. You may restrict your empirical discussions to particular forms of action or regions."
fall2012,afternoon,The notions of Fascists and Fascism have made a comeback in public discussions with the notion of “Islamic fascism” applied to radical Islamist movements. How do you assess the relevance of this notion in light of the literature on (1) the structural and/or conjunctural factors conditioning the emergence of Fascist movements and (2) their ideology.
winter2012,morning,"For quite some time, analysts of the nation-state have emphasized the need to analytically distinguish between state formation and nation building. Yet, in the contemporary period, these two processes have been closely related. Write an essay in which you discuss how political sociology highlights the relation between nation and state. Begin by clarifying how nation and state are distinguished in the theories you are using and clearly indicate which research traditions you will engage."
winter2012,morning,"Theories of the welfare state have been primarily elaborated to account for the emergence of welfare state institutions in Western Europe and North America. How well do these models highlight the changes and the resilience of the welfare states in affluent Western countries since the 1980s? In your answer, pick three of the models, briefly summarize their key arguments on the development of welfare state in Western countries, and assess their respective strengths and weaknesses to explain the changes of welfare states since the 1980s."
winter2012,morning,"Broadly-construed rational action models or assumptions undergird a great deal of political sociology. Write an essay in which you summarize and evaluate several lines of political sociology in the broad rational action tradition, discussing the assumptions made, conclusions reached, extent to which the theory provides a good account of the phenomena in question, and strengths and limitations of the work. NOTE: By ""broadly construed"" is meant approaches that go beyond assumptions of narrow economic self-interest to include collective benefits or goals and normative and value concerns, as well as adaptive learning models, uncertainty models and others that relax the strict assumptions of narrow rational choice models."
winter2012,morning,"Since the publication of Putnam’s Making Democracy Work, there has been much debate on the relationship between social capital and democracy in a complex society. Several authors have criticized Putnam’s conceptualization of social capital as well as his claims regarding its manifold positive effects in a complex society. Summarize the key claims of both Putnam and his critics, and provide your own assessment. Do you think social capital still offers a useful framework for research on political and economic institutions in a complex society?"
winter2012,morning,"The notion of populism is widely used in both journalistic and scholarly circles to describe movements and politicians whose appeals to the ""people"" are perceived as a threat to democratic institutions. Drawing on the social-scientific uses of the notion and on past and contemporary examples, discuss its possible relevance for our understanding of political challenges within democratic polities."
winter2012,afternoon,"Select the Tea Party protests of 2009-10, the Madison protests of 2011, and/or the Occupy protests of 2011. This question presupposes that you know some empirical basic facts from your own reading or experience about the protests you select for discussion; you are not being “tested” on this knowledge about the movement(s) you select, but are rather being asked write an essay which brings this knowledge into dialog with two or more lines of theory/research on social movements or political sociology more broadly. You should write an essay in which you show how the movement(s) you select exemplify or reinforce the theory/research traditions, or show how the movement(s) you select contradict or pose challenges for these traditions, or explain what important questions arise in the juxtaposition of these movements with prior theory/research. In developing your essay, be sure to state the “facts” about the movement(s) that you are taking as true. (Some possible topics might be: movement origins, social bases of movements, mobilization processes, diffusion processes, media coverage, role of outside resources and organizers, relations between movements and electoral politics)."
winter2012,afternoon,"Focusing on major works published in the past few decades, compare three distinctive methodological approaches in the social movement literature. What are their limitations and contributions? Which questions or problems is each approach particularly well-suited for? Do you see any recent study — related or not to the social movement literature — that offers some promising methodological directions for social movement research?"
winter2012,afternoon,"There is no want of explanatory models of revolutions. Select at least three of these models to assess whether and in which respects they shed light on the revolutionary events that have been taking place in the Middle East since last spring. In your essay, clearly state the main claims of the models that you are discussing."
winter2012,afternoon,"Contrast at least two alternative explanatory approaches to political violence. In your essay, summarize the arguments underlying each approach and examine the relevant empirical research. Does the literature on political violence yield robust causal insights?"
winter2012,afternoon,"A great deal has been written about war’s effects on regime change. Draw on studies of state formation, revolution, and/or other relevant lines of research and theory to discuss the effects of war on political regimes.

fall2011,morning,"In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing body of literature that explores the  intersection of welfare state, women, and family (including a recent book by Esping-Andersen, The Incomplete Revolution.  (a) Briefly summarize the comparative and/or  historical studies you believe have made the most important contributions in this area. (b)  Discuss how gender and family_related issues have shaped the institutions of welfare state  in Western democratic countries. (c) Discuss how the welfare state has contributed to the  reproduction of gender hierarchies or reformed gender inequality in different countries.   "
fall2011,morning,"Welfare states have often been divided into types on various criteria — including but not  limited to program types and coverage, levels of “social wage” substitution for market  results, treatment of gender inequality, and characteristic organization of political support.   (a) Discuss which you consider the two most useful typologies for accounting for cross-national variations, and (b) explain why they are better than other, less useful approaches,  for which you should also provide some summary.  (c)  Do you think either of these “useful”  typologies helps to explain variation in how European states are responding to their  increasing ethnic and religious diversity? Why or why not? "
fall2011,morning,"The US is often cited for being “exceptional” compared to Western Europe for its under-developed welfare state, usually attributed in some fashion to its lack of a strong organized  working class.  Discuss the exceptionalism of the US welfare state in relation to: (a)  at least  two comparative/historical explanations for the manifest differences in social provision  between the US and Western Europe;  and (b) the intersection of race, gender and class in  the politics of the US (and Europe). Finally, (c) consider whether European welfare cutbacks,  ethnic disharmony, nationalist/nativist mobilizations, and the end of the cold war have  changed the theoretical and empirical merits of American exceptionalism as an approach or  concept.   "
fall2011,morning,"As recent protests in the Middle East show, repression works sometimes but not always. In  fact, it could backfire and escalate protest. Drawing on the research on political repression  in social movements and also other social movement theories, discuss (a) when repression  would be expected to work and (b) when it does and does not. (c) How would you evaluate  the state of our knowledge about the effects of repression?  "

(c) What broad  conclusions can be drawn about such movements? What are the points of dispute or  unanswered questions?"
fall2011,afternoon,"A distinction is often made between realist or material interest understandings of politics  on the one hand and cultural or social constructionist approaches on the other. Compare  and contrast the core assumptions of the realist/material interest theories to those of the  cultural/constructionist theories with regard to any THREE of the following features of  political experience: the psychology of choice, the history of institutions, economic  determination, networks and alliances, the formation of elites and mass publics, grievances  and agendas. Be sure to use specific examples from the works of authors associated with  each perspective to illustrate your three comparisons "
fall2011,afternoon,"Since the early twentieth century, sociologists have developed different theoretical models  of actually existing democracy, including competitive elitism (Weber, Schumpeter),  pluralism (Dahl, Truman, Almond and Verba), the power-elite model (Mills), and neo-Marxist models of capitalist democracy (Miliband, Poulantzas).  Compare and contrast any  THREE models and assess their respective strengths and weaknesses.  Be sure to support  your answer with references to specific authors and works (those mentioned above and/or  others)."

(a) Select two scholars  who offer different approaches to explaining the rise of gender politics on the international  agenda and summarize their arguments. (b) What questions do their accounts leave open  for further research, what specific forms of empirical evidence would be needed to answer  them, and why are these questions important? "

winter2011,morning,"Gender, race, religion and other “identity” politics frustrate class-based political organization and yet fuel the most intense and enduring political engagements. What does political sociology tell us about how these tensions in mobilization (a) become manifest; (b) affect the acquisition and use of state power; encourage or suppress other means of political influence by subordinated groups? Be sure to include references to at least three specific authors and works in your answer. "
winter2011,morning,"Following Theda Skocpol's call for bringing the state back in in the study of revolutions, numerous studies of revolutionary upheavals have placed the state at the center of their analysis. One of the justifications advanced by the proponents of a state-centered approach is that successful revolutions based on popular mobilizations involve the collapse or incapacitation of state institutions. Write an essay in which you assess the contributions and limitations of this broad approach. Have political sociologists learnt anything that they did not already know regarding the emergence, development and outcomes of revolutions by focusing on the state? In your assessment, clearly define the terms you use and refer to specific case studies. "

What, if anything, do these concepts significantly add to our understanding of the forms and content of political struggles? Be sure to support your answer with references to specific authors and works. "
winter2011,afternoon,"Political sociologists have long been interested in how mass media influences politics. Recently the role of new social media such as Twitter or Facebook in politics has drawn a lot of attention. Some suggest that new social media are reinventing political and social activism by making it easier for people to collaborate, coordinate and give voice to their interests and concerns. Drawing on the literature on political participation and social movements, evaluate this claim. Be sure that you cite at least three specific authors and works. "
winter2011,afternoon,"The theoretical discussion of public discourse about political issues spans several different areas – social movements and framing, law and rights consciousness, media and agenda-setting, political campaigns and marketing candidates. Identify what you think are the most important commonalities in these literatures and the ways in which they meaningfully diverge.

winter2011,afternoon,Social movements have arguably globalized and become transnational political actors. To what extent do you find this argument persuasive (or not) and why? What is the role of nationalism and nation-states in contemporary movements that would tend to either support or challenge assertions about transnationalism among movements?
winter2011,afternoon,"Reviewing recent empirical studies on the effect of globalization on the welfare state, Brady, Beckfield, and Zhao (2007) conclude that the welfare state has probably not experienced the dramatic decline or expansion that the earlier theoretical literature (e.g. Garrett 1998; Huber and Stephens 2001) had predicted. If we accept this conclusion, how would you explain the resilience of the welfare state in the face of the challenges posed by globalization? In your answer, 1) briefly outline the theoretical arguments on how globalization would affect the welfare state positively or negatively; 2) explain possible sources of the resilience of the welfare state in the face of globalization; 3) how Brady et al.’s conclusion may have not accurately characterized the effects of globalization on the welfare state.
