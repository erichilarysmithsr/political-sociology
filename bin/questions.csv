fall2012,morning,"Scholars (e.g., Tocqueville, Lipset, Bollen and Jackman, Treisman) have often observed a strong association between Protestantism and democracy, not only in Western Europe and European- settler colonies, but also in Asian and African countries that were not Protestant European-settler colonies. Drawing on major theories of the development of or conditions for democracy, write an essay that develops one or more arguments to explain the association. Is the association causal? If yes, what is the mechanism? If not, what is the non-causal explanation for the association? "
fall2012,morning,Scholars of welfare state have suggested that America is exceptional in that its welfare programs developed late and also their coverage is relatively inadequate. Is American welfare state really exceptional? Discuss scholarly works on historical development of American welfare regime and offer your evaluations. 
fall2012,morning,"Over the last fifteen years, increasing attention has been paid to an ""eventful approach"" to political phenomena. Brubaker (2001) for instance has suggested that such an approach should be applied to nationalism. Referring to the relevant authors, outline what in your view is the gist of an ""eventful approach"" to political sociology and then discuss what could be the point of such an approach when we study nationalism and nationalist movements."
fall2012,morning,"In his book on revolutions and revolutionary movements, Goodwin argues that “the success or failure of revolutionary movements depends ...upon the nature of specific states that revolutionaries have sought to overthrow” (No Other Way Out, p. 24). Drawing on the literature on revolutions past and contemporary, discuss the empirical and analytical soundness of this statement."
fall2012,morning,"Civil society is one of the central concepts in political sociology. Choose two different analytic approaches to civil society and examine their contributions and drawbacks. In your essay, a) briefly describe each approach, summarizing what civil society means in each approach and what kinds of relationships, groups, institutions it includes or highlight; b) discuss what theoretical and empirical weaknesses in earlier research are addressed by each approach; 3) compare and contrast the two approaches and offer your assessment on which approach has the most promise for advancing empirical research."
fall2012,morning,"Are states agents, actors or arenas? Write an essay comparing and contrasting the answer to this question for three or more general theoretical conceptions of the relation between state and society."
fall2012,afternoon,"Two decades ago, one could reasonably claim that McAdam’s political process model of political mobilization had become a referential model for any full-fledged analysis of collective mobilization. Do you view this characterization of the field as appropriate nowadays? Write an essay that (1) sketches the political process model and then (2) either defends or refutes the claim that this model is still referential with references to recent work on collective mobilization."
fall2012,afternoon,"In recent Presidential elections in the United States (including the current one), there has been much discussion on how white, working class voters have defected from the Democratic Party and tend to vote for Republican candidates, whereas more affluent and educated voters in liberal states vote for Democratic candidates. What do political sociologists know about class and voting behaviors in the U.S.? Has there been “de-alignment” between social class and how people vote in national elections? What are the theoretical or historical explanations of class voting and “de- alignment” proposed by scholars? What do recent empirical studies suggest about class voting in the U.S.?"
fall2012,afternoon,"The US has seen two waves of popular protest in the past three years, first the Tea Party protests of 2009-10 and then the wave of protests beginning with the Wisconsin uprising and supportive labor protests elsewhere and followed by (flowing into?) the Occupy protests. Both protest waves were linked somehow to partisan electoral politics, but participants and analysts disputed the nature of these links. How do these protest waves fit into the broader literature on the relation between social movements and institutional and electoral politics? In writing your essay, provide a summary of prior theory and research about the issue generally, and then discuss the extent to which these two protest waves fit into or are at variance with prior research."
fall2012,afternoon,"""Identity politics” seems to be a major feature of political life in the US, Europe, and elsewhere. Write an essay in which you: (1) discuss how the idea of a political or collective identity has been defined by political sociologists and (2) discuss theoretical and empirical work on the significance of political or collective identity in electoral politics and/or social movements and protest. (3) Consider whether identity politics is best understand as a distinct kind of politics to be contrasted with other kinds of politics or best understood as a theoretical process that occurs in all politics. You may restrict your empirical discussions to particular forms of action or regions."
fall2012,afternoon,The notions of Fascists and Fascism have made a comeback in public discussions with the notion of “Islamic fascism” applied to radical Islamist movements. How do you assess the relevance of this notion in light of the literature on (1) the structural and/or conjunctural factors conditioning the emergence of Fascist movements and (2) their ideology.
winter2012,morning,"For quite some time, analysts of the nation-state have emphasized the need to analytically distinguish between state formation and nation building. Yet, in the contemporary period, these two processes have been closely related. Write an essay in which you discuss how political sociology highlights the relation between nation and state. Begin by clarifying how nation and state are distinguished in the theories you are using and clearly indicate which research traditions you will engage."
winter2012,morning,"Theories of the welfare state have been primarily elaborated to account for the emergence of welfare state institutions in Western Europe and North America. How well do these models highlight the changes and the resilience of the welfare states in affluent Western countries since the 1980s? In your answer, pick three of the models, briefly summarize their key arguments on the development of welfare state in Western countries, and assess their respective strengths and weaknesses to explain the changes of welfare states since the 1980s."
winter2012,morning,"Broadly-construed rational action models or assumptions undergird a great deal of political sociology. Write an essay in which you summarize and evaluate several lines of political sociology in the broad rational action tradition, discussing the assumptions made, conclusions reached, extent to which the theory provides a good account of the phenomena in question, and strengths and limitations of the work. NOTE: By ""broadly construed"" is meant approaches that go beyond assumptions of narrow economic self-interest to include collective benefits or goals and normative and value concerns, as well as adaptive learning models, uncertainty models and others that relax the strict assumptions of narrow rational choice models."
winter2012,morning,"Since the publication of Putnam’s Making Democracy Work, there has been much debate on the relationship between social capital and democracy in a complex society. Several authors have criticized Putnam’s conceptualization of social capital as well as his claims regarding its manifold positive effects in a complex society. Summarize the key claims of both Putnam and his critics, and provide your own assessment. Do you think social capital still offers a useful framework for research on political and economic institutions in a complex society?"
winter2012,morning,"The notion of populism is widely used in both journalistic and scholarly circles to describe movements and politicians whose appeals to the ""people"" are perceived as a threat to democratic institutions. Drawing on the social-scientific uses of the notion and on past and contemporary examples, discuss its possible relevance for our understanding of political challenges within democratic polities."
winter2012,afternoon,"Select the Tea Party protests of 2009-10, the Madison protests of 2011, and/or the Occupy protests of 2011. This question presupposes that you know some empirical basic facts from your own reading or experience about the protests you select for discussion; you are not being “tested” on this knowledge about the movement(s) you select, but are rather being asked write an essay which brings this knowledge into dialog with two or more lines of theory/research on social movements or political sociology more broadly. You should write an essay in which you show how the movement(s) you select exemplify or reinforce the theory/research traditions, or show how the movement(s) you select contradict or pose challenges for these traditions, or explain what important questions arise in the juxtaposition of these movements with prior theory/research. In developing your essay, be sure to state the “facts” about the movement(s) that you are taking as true. (Some possible topics might be: movement origins, social bases of movements, mobilization processes, diffusion processes, media coverage, role of outside resources and organizers, relations between movements and electoral politics)."
winter2012,afternoon,"Focusing on major works published in the past few decades, compare three distinctive methodological approaches in the social movement literature. What are their limitations and contributions? Which questions or problems is each approach particularly well-suited for? Do you see any recent study — related or not to the social movement literature — that offers some promising methodological directions for social movement research?"
winter2012,afternoon,"There is no want of explanatory models of revolutions. Select at least three of these models to assess whether and in which respects they shed light on the revolutionary events that have been taking place in the Middle East since last spring. In your essay, clearly state the main claims of the models that you are discussing."
winter2012,afternoon,"Contrast at least two alternative explanatory approaches to political violence. In your essay, summarize the arguments underlying each approach and examine the relevant empirical research. Does the literature on political violence yield robust causal insights?"
winter2012,afternoon,"A great deal has been written about war’s effects on regime change. Draw on studies of state formation, revolution, and/or other relevant lines of research and theory to discuss the effects of war on political regimes. Summarize and assess what you take to be the central conclusions of this field of research and the mechanisms it identifies."
fall2011,morning,"In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing body of literature that explores the  intersection of welfare state, women, and family (including a recent book by Esping-Andersen, The Incomplete Revolution.  (a) Briefly summarize the comparative and/or  historical studies you believe have made the most important contributions in this area. (b)  Discuss how gender and family_related issues have shaped the institutions of welfare state  in Western democratic countries. (c) Discuss how the welfare state has contributed to the  reproduction of gender hierarchies or reformed gender inequality in different countries.   "
fall2011,morning,"Welfare states have often been divided into types on various criteria — including but not  limited to program types and coverage, levels of “social wage” substitution for market  results, treatment of gender inequality, and characteristic organization of political support.   (a) Discuss which you consider the two most useful typologies for accounting for cross-national variations, and (b) explain why they are better than other, less useful approaches,  for which you should also provide some summary.  (c)  Do you think either of these “useful”  typologies helps to explain variation in how European states are responding to their  increasing ethnic and religious diversity? Why or why not? "
fall2011,morning,"The US is often cited for being “exceptional” compared to Western Europe for its under-developed welfare state, usually attributed in some fashion to its lack of a strong organized  working class.  Discuss the exceptionalism of the US welfare state in relation to: (a)  at least  two comparative/historical explanations for the manifest differences in social provision  between the US and Western Europe;  and (b) the intersection of race, gender and class in  the politics of the US (and Europe). Finally, (c) consider whether European welfare cutbacks,  ethnic disharmony, nationalist/nativist mobilizations, and the end of the cold war have  changed the theoretical and empirical merits of American exceptionalism as an approach or  concept.   "
fall2011,morning,"As recent protests in the Middle East show, repression works sometimes but not always. In  fact, it could backfire and escalate protest. Drawing on the research on political repression  in social movements and also other social movement theories, discuss (a) when repression  would be expected to work and (b) when it does and does not. (c) How would you evaluate  the state of our knowledge about the effects of repression?  "
fall2011,morning,"How do you conceptualize the links between contentious politics, electoral politics, and  public policy? (a) In your view, what theorist or theorists make the most sense of these  connections? (b) Point to a set of three or more empirical studies that operationalize this  (personally preferred) approach and discuss what they have best explained about these  links and (c) what issues are still waiting to be addressed by other scholars. "
fall2011,morning,"Right-wing movements are now objects of intense scholarly concern in both Europe and the  US and have long been of interest in many regions of the world. Review the scholarship on  the radical right in one or more regions regarding its theories, methods and findings. Be  specific about which regions you are considering.  (a) How are these movements  conceptualized? Are they seen as relatively unified and coherent or as consisting of distinct  strands?

(c) What broad  conclusions can be drawn about such movements? What are the points of dispute or  unanswered questions?"
fall2011,afternoon,"A distinction is often made between realist or material interest understandings of politics  on the one hand and cultural or social constructionist approaches on the other. Compare  and contrast the core assumptions of the realist/material interest theories to those of the  cultural/constructionist theories with regard to any THREE of the following features of  political experience: the psychology of choice, the history of institutions, economic  determination, networks and alliances, the formation of elites and mass publics, grievances  and agendas. Be sure to use specific examples from the works of authors associated with  each perspective to illustrate your three comparisons "
fall2011,afternoon,"Since the early twentieth century, sociologists have developed different theoretical models  of actually existing democracy, including competitive elitism (Weber, Schumpeter),  pluralism (Dahl, Truman, Almond and Verba), the power-elite model (Mills), and neo-Marxist models of capitalist democracy (Miliband, Poulantzas).  Compare and contrast any  THREE models and assess their respective strengths and weaknesses.  Be sure to support  your answer with references to specific authors and works (those mentioned above and/or  others)."
fall2011,afternoon,"Pierre Bourdieu argues that the state is the principal “repository of symbolic power in the  modern world.” (a) How does Bourdieu’s conception of the sources and exercise of state  power differ from conceptions of state power in the work of Weber and Marx? (b) In your  answer, you should include some consideration of  conceptions of state power in more  recent scholarship in the Weberian or Marxist traditions. (c) In your view, what are the  strengths and weaknesses of these distinct perspectives on state power for addressing key  questions confronting political sociology of the state today?  "
fall2011,afternoon,"Gender has emerged into the mainstream of political discussion, whether in such US venues  as the NY Times (e.g. Kristoff) or in international forums (e.g. the recent establishment of an  office on gender research and policy in the UN and one in the EU).  (a) Select two scholars  who offer different approaches to explaining the rise of gender politics on the international  agenda and summarize their arguments. (b) What questions do their accounts leave open  for further research, what specific forms of empirical evidence would be needed to answer  them, and why are these questions important? "
fall2011,afternoon,"Is there a transnational politics? (a) What is the role of national interests, national  citizenship and national politics in shaping the emergence and functioning of the politics  (contentious or conventional) that can be seen at the transnational level? (b) Is there any  “space” left over for transnational factors themselves to play an independent role? Use  specific studies as evidence to argue your case. "
winter2011,morning,"Gender, race, religion and other “identity” politics frustrate class-based political organization and yet fuel the most intense and enduring political engagements. What does political sociology tell us about how these tensions in mobilization (a) become manifest; (b) affect the acquisition and use of state power; encourage or suppress other means of political influence by subordinated groups? Be sure to include references to at least three specific authors and works in your answer. "
winter2011,morning,"Following Theda Skocpol's call for bringing the state back in in the study of revolutions, numerous studies of revolutionary upheavals have placed the state at the center of their analysis. One of the justifications advanced by the proponents of a state-centered approach is that successful revolutions based on popular mobilizations involve the collapse or incapacitation of state institutions. Write an essay in which you assess the contributions and limitations of this broad approach. Have political sociologists learnt anything that they did not already know regarding the emergence, development and outcomes of revolutions by focusing on the state? In your assessment, clearly define the terms you use and refer to specific case studies. "
winter2011,morning,"Pierre Bourdieu argues that the state is the principal “repository of symbolic power in the modern world.” How does Bourdieu’s conception of the sources and exercise of state power differ from the conceptions of state power found in the work of Weber and Marx?

In your view, what are the strengths and weaknesses of these three distinct perspectives on state power for addressing key questions confronting political sociology of the state today? "
winter2011,morning,"How can one study “political culture”? What does it mean conceptually and how might one translate that into specific empirical measures? Give one concrete example of an approach to studying political culture that you think has proven fruitful and contrast that with two or three other studies that you think are less well conceptualized, operationalized and/or analyzed. Explain what specifically makes this “better” study a more valid and/or reliable way of studying political culture. "
winter2011,morning,"""Hegemony"" and ""counterhegemony"" are key concepts in sociological analyses of political domination and contention. What, if anything, do these concepts significantly add to our understanding of the forms and content of political struggles? Be sure to support your answer with references to specific authors and works. "
winter2011,afternoon,"Political sociologists have long been interested in how mass media influences politics. Recently the role of new social media such as Twitter or Facebook in politics has drawn a lot of attention. Some suggest that new social media are reinventing political and social activism by making it easier for people to collaborate, coordinate and give voice to their interests and concerns. Drawing on the literature on political participation and social movements, evaluate this claim. Be sure that you cite at least three specific authors and works. "
winter2011,afternoon,"The theoretical discussion of public discourse about political issues spans several different areas – social movements and framing, law and rights consciousness, media and agenda-setting, political campaigns and marketing candidates. Identify what you think are the most important commonalities in these literatures and the ways in which they meaningfully diverge. Be sure to consider similarities and differences in how they deal with the problems of (1) institutional legacies that constrain choice; (2) emotions in relation to rational choice and strategic action; (3) elite and non-elite relationships to ideological manipulation."
winter2011,afternoon,Social movements have arguably globalized and become transnational political actors. To what extent do you find this argument persuasive (or not) and why? What is the role of nationalism and nation-states in contemporary movements that would tend to either support or challenge assertions about transnationalism among movements?
winter2011,afternoon,"Reviewing recent empirical studies on the effect of globalization on the welfare state, Brady, Beckfield, and Zhao (2007) conclude that the welfare state has probably not experienced the dramatic decline or expansion that the earlier theoretical literature (e.g. Garrett 1998; Huber and Stephens 2001) had predicted. If we accept this conclusion, how would you explain the resilience of the welfare state in the face of the challenges posed by globalization? In your answer, 1) briefly outline the theoretical arguments on how globalization would affect the welfare state positively or negatively; 2) explain possible sources of the resilience of the welfare state in the face of globalization; 3) how Brady et al.’s conclusion may have not accurately characterized the effects of globalization on the welfare state. "
fall2010,morning,"There has been a great deal of debate—both public and scholarly—on cultural and political polarization in America. Much of the debate seems to focus on whether America has become more polarized in recent decades and, if so, why. Less attention has been paid to the potential consequences of polarization for democratic politics. Much recent discussion treats polarization as bad because it intensifies social and political conflicts which, in turn, decrease social cohesion and community or public spirit. However, earlier scholars (e.g., Simmel, Coser, Lipset, Hirschman) often argued that conflicts are not only inevitable but also essential to the function of democratic society. Compare several of these different views on the role of conflicts in democratic politics and discuss their implications for the potential consequences of the “Culture War” on democratic politics in America."
fall2010,morning,"Since Putnam’s Making Democracy Work, the role of social capital in democratic politics has drawn much attention as well as criticism. Summarize and evaluate Putnam’s key arguments and those of some of the critics of Putnam. In light of these arguments, discuss whether you think social capital is still a useful theoretical tool for studying democratic politics. What are the strengths and limitations of the concept of social capital? What are the alternatives?"
fall2010,morning,"What do you think is the best way to conceptualize the links between contentious politics, electoral politics, and public policy? In your view, which theorists make the most sense of these connections? Summarize examples of empirical studies that have used the approach you prefer and explain why the approach gives a good account for the links between contentious politics, electoral politics and public policy. Then discuss the limitations or weaknesses of this approach. (If you prefer, instead of focusing on one approach, you may compare different theoretical approaches to these links and give examples of empirical studies using each and conclude by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.)"
fall2010,morning,"Social movement scholars have observed that religion played important roles in various social movements in America. Discuss the relationship between religion and social movements in the U.S. from different theoretical perspectives on social movements (e.g., resource mobilization, framing, new social movements, biopolitics, gender) and in the context of specific examples of historical or contemporary social movements from the US or elsewhere. Bring in examples of published empirical work on religion and social movements as well as more general theoretical insights."
fall2010,morning,"In his recent book What Makes a Terrorist, the economist Alan Krueger observes that people often turn to a simple explanation that economic deprivation and a lack of education cause people to adopt extreme views and turn to terrorism. Seeing deprivation as the cause of movements is, of course, a very longstanding line of argument among social scientists, but several decades of social movement scholarship have shown the importance of other factors as well: political opportunity structure, resource mobilization, framing, repertoires of collective action, micro-mobilization, etc. What would explanations would other social movement theories for explaining how terrorism emerges, who becomes a terrorist, or the patterns of terrorism across space and time? You may interweave citations to empirical research on terrorism with discussions of predictions theories would imply in writing your answer."
fall2010,morning,"How are comparative and historical data used in the development of social movement theories? Pick any two commonly used approaches to studying movement mobilization processes and compare them on (a) the extent to which scholars using this model rely on historical evidence as well as contemporary cases; (b) the extent to which they generalize beyond the specific political configurations of a particular country or region; (c) the extent to which they aspire to be generalizable across time and place. In either or both approached, do you think the evidence being used is as broad as it should be, or inappropriately self-limiting and why?"
fall2010,afternoon,"T.H. Marshall's enumeration of different types of citizenship rights as informed much scholarship on the welfare state. Recently, there is increasing attention to the variation in the timing and composition of rights “packages” that are offered to different classes of residents in different countries. Pick a country or set of countries and discuss the scholarship that attempts to explain the increase (or continued absence/decrease) of rights of various types for various groups over the past generation (20-30 years). What useful insights (if any) does Marshall’s model contribute to understanding this process of change and resistance? Are there points where you feel that Marshall's model breaks down? What supplements or alternatives would you suggest?"
fall2010,afternoon,"The social constructionist approach to politics is enjoying a resurgence of popularity relative to realist material interest models across many areas of political sociology from international relations at the macro level to voter behavior at the micro level. Compare and contrast the core assumptions of the realist/material interest models to those of cultural or constructionist models with regard to any THREE of the following features of political experience: the psychology of choice, the history of institutions, economic determination, networks and alliances, the formation of elites and mass publics, voting behavior, grievances and agendas. Use specific examples from the works of authors associated with each perspective to illustrate your comparisons."
fall2010,afternoon,"Path dependency is a core concept used in explaining the development of welfare states and other phenomena in political sociology, although some critics like James Mahoney argue that it has been over-used and under-defined. First define the concept of path dependence and what the term should properly encompass. Second, give examples from the political sociology literature in which it has been used appropriately to explain continuity and change in political practices or public policies. Third, discuss critiques of ways in which the concept can be over-extended or misused, with examples of cases in which critics have accused others of misusing the concept of path dependency. What is your conclusion about the appropriate and inappropriate uses of this concept?"
fall2010,afternoon,Write an essay in which you provide a review of the different ways power has been conceptualized in political sociology and apply these different approaches to the concept of power to understanding the recent trajectory of health care and health insurance reform in the US.
fall2010,afternoon,"One approach to the study of political cultures is through the analysis of public discourse. Discuss the assumptions that need to be made to connect culture in general with specific manifestations of discourse both theoretically and analytically. Compare the theoretical approaches suggested by any two theorists of political discourse (Dorothy Smith, Michel Foucault, Paul Lichterman, Deborah Stone, William Gamson, etc). Critically analyze two empirical studies of political discourse of your choice, one chosen to represent an effective approach to understanding political culture and one chosen to be an illustratively problematic study."
fall2010,afternoon,"Is there a transnational politics? What is the role of national interests, national citizenship and national politics in shaping the emergence and functioning of the politics (contentious or conventional) that can be seen at the transnational level? Is there any “space” left over for an independent effect of transnational factors themselves to play a role? Use specific studies as evidence to argue your case. If you choose, you may focus your answer on one case such as the rise of gender politics on the international agenda."
winter2010,morning,"The major theories of the welfare state were developed to explain the expansion of social programs in advanced industrial countries. Over the last three decades, however, welfare states in affluent democratic countries have faced serious challenges such as the globalized economy and increasing ethnic and religious diversity. As a result, the focus of welfare state research has shifted from the expansion to the crisis and retrenchment of the welfare state. Can the theories of welfare state expansion also explain the retrenchment? Sketch the main arguments of at least two theories of welfare state expansion and discuss how well they explain (or do not explain) the variations in politics of welfare state retrenchment."
winter2010,morning,"On the surface, theorists of modern state formation tend to agree that the rise of modern states in Western Europe resulted from a combination of political-coercive processes, economic processes, and cultural processes. Yet existing accounts of modern state formation differ markedly in emphasis: some theorists focus primarily on political-coercive dynamics, others on economic dynamics, and still others on cultural dynamics. Select three authors, each representing one of these perspectives, and summarize their primary arguments about the processes that fueled the rise of modern states. Do these three authors offer competing explanations of the same thing or complementary explanations for different parts of a larger story? To what extent are their accounts compatible, if at all? Do you find one perspective more compelling than the others, and if so, why? (Relevant authors include, among others: Charles Tilly, Brian Downing, Gianfranco Poggi, Thomas Ertman, Michael Mann, Perry Anderson, Phil Gorski, Julia Adams.)"
winter2010,morning,"In a recent Annual Review article, Andrew Walder criticizes the sociological literature on social movements for its focus on the process of mobilization rather than on explaining the political orientation of movements. He says: ""[social movement studies] ... redefined the central problem, radically narrowing the scope of interest to the process of mobilization—how social groups, whoever they are and whatever their aims, marshal resources, recruit adherents, and navigate political environments in order to grow and succeed. Critics would later insist that the construction of meaning, the formation of collective identities, and the stimulation and amplification of emotions play vital and neglected roles in mobilization, but these alternatives did not challenge the narrowed construction of the problem itself. The resulting subfield has largely abandoned the quest to explain variation in the political orientation of movements."" Whether or not you have read this particular article, the critique raises questions which you can address based on your reading of the social movement literature: (1) Are the mobilization processes the same or different for movements with different political orientations? That is, do you see similar abstract processes working in different kinds of movements, or not? (2) Could mobilization processes account for some or all of the differences between movements with different political orientations? Why or why not? (3) What are some of the factors other than mobilization processes that could explain the political orientations of movements? Give examples of particular movements with different orientations to illustrate your arguments for both questions."
winter2010,morning,"In the 1980s, social movement research was divided between a “resource-mobilization” paradigm (prevalent in the United States) and a competing “identity-oriented” paradigm (dominant in Western Europe). How did these paradigms differ? How has more recent research tried to move beyond this dichotomy or integrate these paradigms? Assess these attempted syntheses. Be sure to support your answer with references to specific authors and works and specific examples from at least one historical or contemporary social movement."
winter2010,afternoon,"In the last couple of decades, there has been broad interest and lively debate about the health of American civil society and democracy. A wide array of scholars seems to agree that American civil society has experienced some important transformations, but they disagree on the scope, nature, cause, and consequence of the transformations. Pick several key works or lines of work and summarize their key arguments and findings. Assess their contributions to our understanding of democracy and civic participation."
winter2010,afternoon,"Since the early twentieth century, sociologists have developed different models of democracy: competitive elitism (Weber, Schumpeter), pluralism (Dahl, Truman, Almond and Verba), the power-elite model (Mills), neo-Marxist models of capitalist democracy (Miliband, Poulantzas), and so forth. Compare and contrast any three models of democracy and assess their respective strengths and weaknesses.

winter2010,afternoon,Social networks are increasingly seen as important in a number of different areas of political sociology. Summarize theoretical and empirical works about social networks in one or more areas of political sociology with special attention to the different kinds of network ties and mechanisms studied. Discuss how these works on social networks relate to existing approaches in the areas you focus on.
fall2009,morning,"Several authors have called for greater analytical attention to the ideational component of state formation processes. How do you assess the strengths and limitations of this approach? In your essay, be sure to refer to specific studies and to clearly define the terms you use."
fall2009,morning,"A 2006 article in the American Journal of Sociology lamented the lack of cultural analysis in “mainstream perspectives” on the U.S. welfare state: “The narrative sections of some studies make passing reference to cultural categories of worth. But the theoretical frameworks used to explain policy development emphasize the significance of other factors, most prominently the power of business, social movement pressure, the role of government bureaucrats, and the institutional structure of the polity.” Respond to this claim in two steps: first, review to what extent and in what ways sociologists have invoked cultural factors to explain the development of the welfare state; then, in light of the research you have reviewed, assess the significance of these cultural factors. Note: You can answer this question whether or not you have read or are prepared to evaluate this particular AJS article."
fall2009,morning,"Chuck Tilly is often quoted as saying, ""Repression works."" How does it work? Is repression just the absence of political opportunity? Is repression different in democratic and non-democratic regimes? How does the policing of protest vary across time and place, and does this affect the power of non-elites? Should ""soft"" repression like ridicule be theorized alongside ""hard"" repression like arresting or killing protesters? Are tax codes and non-profit law part of repression? The word repression is used by different writers in different ways, but (at least in the opinion of this question-writer) there is no good comprehensive theory of repression. Write an essay in which you summarize some of the strands of theory and research about repression and the policing/control of protest or political opposition and discuss the utility of these strands for understanding movement or protest dynamics in the past 50 years (or perhaps the past 12 months) with reference to one or more particular cases.

fall2009,morning,"In a recent study, Rory McVeigh argues that the prevailing theories of social movements do not adequately explain the rise of right-wing movements like the Ku Klux Klan because these theories (1) characterize the participants of rightist movements as irrational or misguided, or (2) were intended to explain the mobilization of powerless groups to bring about social change rather than advantaged groups to preserve, restore, or expand their privileges. How do you assess these claims? How have social movement theories explained rightist movements? Are existing explanations adequate? Do these explanations differ—and should they differ—from explanations of leftist movements? Note: you can answer these questions based on your own readings whether or not you have read or are prepared to evaluate McVeigh's book."

In your essay, be sure to discuss different ways of operationalizing this concept and to refer to different case studies. "

"
winter2009,afternoon,"How useful is the analytical distinction between “ethnic” and “civic” nationalism? Does it capture a real difference in modes of “imagining” nationhood? Or is the analytical distinction simply a normative claim masquerading as a neutral social scientific conceptual scheme? Even if it does sometimes mask normative claims, can analysts easily dispose of the civic/ethnic distinction? What alternatives to the civic/ethnic distinction have been proposed in the literature and do they provide more leverage for our analyses of nationalism? Be sure to include references to specific authors and works in your answer. "

winter2009,afternoon,"Does globalization undermine the nation-state? Some argue that increasing transnational flows of persons, commodities, capital, symbols and ideas undermine the future existence of the territorial nation- state as the world’s preeminent political form.

Discuss which you consider the two most useful typologies for accounting for cross-national variations, and explain why they are better than others. (In the process provide some summary of the approaches you consider to be less useful.) Moreover, do you think either of these “useful” typologies help to explain variation in how European states are responding to their increasing ethnic and religious diversity? Why or why not?"
fall2008,afternoon,"The US is often cited for being “exceptional” compared to Western Europe for its under- developed welfare state and/or lack of a strong organized working class.
